Introduction
About the Handbook
The Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam is computer-based, and the FE Reference Handbook is the only resource
material you may use during the exam. Reviewing it before exam day will help you become familiar with the charts,
formulas, tables, and other reference information provided. You won't be allowed to bring your personal copy of the
Handbook into the exam room. Instead, the computer-based exam will include a PDF version of the Handbook for your use.
No printed copies of the Handbook will be allowed in the exam room.
The PDF version of the FE Reference Handbook that you use on exam day will be very similar to the printed version. Pages
not needed to solve exam questions—such as the cover, introductory material, index, and exam specifications—will not be
included in the PDF version. In addition, NCEES will periodically revise and update the Handbook, and each FE exam will
be administered using the updated version.
The FE Reference Handbook does not contain all the information required to answer every question on the exam. Basic
theories, conversions, formulas, and definitions examinees are expected to know have not been included. Special material
required for the solution of a particular exam question will be included in the question itself.

Updates on exam content and procedures
NCEES.org is our home on the web. Visit us there for updates on everything exam-related, including specifications, examday policies, scoring, and practice tests. A PDF version of the FE Reference Handbook similar to the one you will use on
exam day is also available there.

Errata
To report errata in this book, send your correction using our chat feature or your account on NCEES.org. We will also post
errata on the website. Examinees are not penalized for any errors in the Handbook that affect an exam question.

Units and Conversion Factors
Distinguishing pound-force from pound-mass
The FE exam and this handbook use both the metric system of units and the U.S. Customary System (USCS). In the USCS system of units,
both force and mass are called pounds. Therefore, one must distinguish the pound-force (lbf) from the pound-mass (lbm).
The pound-force is that force which accelerates one pound-mass at 32.174 ft/sec2. Thus, 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm-ft/sec2. The expression
32.174 lbm-ft/(lbf-sec2) is designated as gc and is used to resolve expressions involving both mass and force expressed as pounds. For instance, in
writing Newton's second law, the equation would be written as F = ma/gc, where F is in lbf, m in lbm, and a is in ft/sec2.
Similar expressions exist for other quantities:
Kinetic energy, KE = mv2/2gc, with KE in (ft-lbf)
Potential energy, PE = mgh/gc, with PE in (ft-lbf)
Fluid pressure, p = ρgh/gc, with p in (lbf/ft2)
Specific weight, SW = ρg/gc, in (lbf/ft3)
Shear stress, τ = (µ/gc)(dv/dy), with shear stress in (lbf/ft2).
In all these examples, gc should be regarded as a force unit conversion factor. It is frequently not written explicitly in engineering equations.
However, its use is required to produce a consistent set of units.
Note that the force unit conversion factor gc [lbm-ft/(lbf-sec2)] should not be confused with the local acceleration of gravity g, which has
different units (m/s2 or ft/sec2) and may be either its standard value (9.807 m/s2 or 32.174 ft/sec2) or some other local value.
If the problem is presented in USCS units, it may be necessary to use the constant gc in the equation to have a consistent set of units.
Constants and conversion factors provided are approximate, with sufficient accuracy to solve exam questions.

Units and Conversion Factors

Significant Figures
Significant figures of numbers in math operations will determine the accuracy of the result. General rules for significant digits
are:
Rule 1: Non-zero digits are always significant.
Rule 2: Any zeros between two significant digits are significant.
Rule 3: All zeros in the decimal portion are significant.
Rule 4 (Addition and Subtraction): The number used in the calculation with the least number of significant digits after the
decimal point dictates the number of significant figures after the decimal point. The number with the most significant figures to
the left of the decimal point dictates the number of significant digits to the left of decimal point.
Rule 5 (Multiplication and Division): The result of the operation has the same number of significant digits as the input
number with the least number of significant digits.
Rule 6: In the solution of engineering problems, it is customary to retain 3–4 significant digits in the final result.

Ideal Gas Constants
The universal gas constant, designated as R in the table below, relates pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an
ideal gas. When that universal constant, R , is divided by the molecular weight of the gas, the result, often designated as R, has units of
energy per degree per unit mass [kJ/(kg·K) or ft-lbf/(lbm-ºR)] and becomes characteristic of the particular gas. Some disciplines, notably
chemical engineering, often use the symbol R to refer to the universal gas constant R .

Ethics and Professional Practice
Code of Ethics
Engineering is considered to be a "profession" rather than an "occupation" because of several important characteristics
shared with other recognized learned professions, law, medicine, and theology: special knowledge, special privileges, and
special responsibilities. Professions are based on a large knowledge base requiring extensive training. Professional skills
are important to the well-being of society. Professions are self-regulating, in that they control the training and evaluation
processes that admit new persons to the field. Professionals have autonomy in the workplace; they are expected to utilize
their independent judgment in carrying out their professional responsibilities. Finally, professions are regulated by ethical
standards. (Harris, C.E., M.S. Pritchard, & M.J. Rabins, Engineering Ethics: Concepts and Cases, Wadsworth Publishing
company, pages 27–28, 1995.)
The expertise possessed by engineers is vitally important to societal welfare. In order to serve society effectively, engineers
must maintain a high level of technical competence. However, a high level of technical expertise without adherence to
ethical guidelines is as much a threat to public welfare as is professional incompetence. Therefore, engineers must also be
guided by ethical principles.
The ethical principles governing the engineering profession are embodied in codes of ethics. Such codes have been adopted
by state boards of registration, professional engineering societies, and even by some private industries. An example of one
such code is the NCEES Rules of Professional Conduct, found in Section 240 of the Model Rules and presented here. As
part of his/her responsibility to the public, an engineer is responsible for knowing and abiding by the code. Additional rules
of conduct are also included in the Model Rules.
The three major sections of the Model Rules address (1) Licensee's Obligation to the Public, (2) Licensee's Obligation to
Employers and Clients, and (3) Licensee's Obligation to Other Licensees. The principles amplified in these sections are
important guides to appropriate behavior of professional engineers.
Application of the code in many situations is not controversial. However, there may be situations in which applying
the code may raise more difficult issues. In particular, there may be circumstances in which terminology in the code is
not clearly defined, or in which two sections of the code may be in conflict. For example, what constitutes "valuable
consideration" or "adequate" knowledge may be interpreted differently by qualified professionals. These types of questions
are called conceptual issues, in which definitions of terms may be in dispute. In other situations, factual issues may also
affect ethical dilemmas. Many decisions regarding engineering design may be based upon interpretation of disputed or
incomplete information. In addition, tradeoffs revolving around competing issues of risk vs. benefit, or safety vs. economics
may require judgments that are not fully addressed simply by application of the code.
No code can give immediate and mechanical answers to all ethical and professional problems that an engineer may face.
Creative problem solving is often called for in ethics, just as it is in other areas of engineering.

Model Rules, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct
To safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the public and to maintain integrity and high standards of skill and practice in
the engineering and surveying professions, the rules of professional conduct provided in this section shall be binding upon
every licensee and on all firms authorized to offer or perform engineering or surveying services in this jurisdiction.
A. Licensee’s Obligation to the Public
1. Licensees shall be cognizant that their first and foremost responsibility is to safeguard the health, safety, and
welfare of the public when performing services for clients and employers.
2. Licensees shall sign and seal only those plans, surveys, and other documents that conform to accepted engineering
and surveying standards and that safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
3. Licensees shall notify their employer or client and such other authority as may be appropriate when their
professional judgment is overruled when the health, safety, or welfare of the public is endangered.
4. Licensees shall, to the best of their knowledge, include all relevant and pertinent information in an objective and
truthful manner within all professional documents, statements, and testimony.
5. Licensees shall express a professional opinion publicly only when it is founded upon an adequate knowledge of the
facts and a competent evaluation of the subject matter.
4

Ethics and Professional Practice
6. Licensees shall issue no statements, criticisms, or arguments on engineering and surveying matters that are inspired
or paid for by interested parties, unless they explicitly identify the interested parties on whose behalf they are
speaking and reveal any interest they have in the matters.
7. Licensees shall not partner, practice, or offer to practice with any person or firm that they know is engaged in
fraudulent or dishonest business or professional practices.
8. Licensees who have knowledge or reason to believe that any person or firm has violated any rules or laws applying
to the practice of engineering or surveying shall report it to the board, may report it to appropriate legal authorities,
and shall cooperate with the board and those authorities as requested.
9. Licensees shall not knowingly provide false or incomplete information regarding an applicant in obtaining
licensure.
10. Licensees shall comply with the licensing laws and rules governing their professional practice in each of the
jurisdictions in which they practice.
B. Licensee’s Obligation to Employer and Clients
1. Licensees shall undertake assignments only when qualified by education or experience in the specific technical
fields of engineering or surveying involved.
2. Licensees shall not affix their signatures or seals to any plans or documents dealing with subject matter in which
they lack competence, nor to any such plan or document not prepared under their responsible charge.
3. Licensees may accept assignments and assume responsibility for coordination of an entire project if each technical
segment is signed and sealed by the licensee responsible for preparation of that technical segment.
4. Licensees shall not reveal facts, data, or information obtained in a professional capacity without the prior consent
of the client, employer, or public body on which they serve except as authorized or required by law or rules.
5. Licensees shall not solicit or accept gratuities, directly or indirectly, from contractors, their agents, or other parties
in connection with work for employers or clients.
6. Licensees shall disclose to their employers or clients all known or potential conflicts of interest or other
circumstances that could influence or appear to influence their judgment or the quality of their professional service
or engagement.
7. Licensees shall not accept compensation, financial or otherwise, from more than one party for services pertaining
to the same project, unless the circumstances are fully disclosed and agreed to in writing by all interested parties.
8. Licensees shall not solicit or accept a professional contract from a governmental body on which a principal or
officer of their organization serves as a member. Conversely, licensees serving as members, advisors, or employees
of a government body or department, who are the principals or employees of a private concern, shall not participate
in decisions with respect to professional services offered or provided by said concern to the governmental body that
they serve.
9. Licensees shall not use confidential information received in the course of their assignments as a means of making
personal profit without the consent of the party from whom the information was obtained.
C. Licensee’s Obligation to Other Licensees
1. Licensees shall not falsify or permit misrepresentation of their, or their associates’, academic or professional
qualifications. They shall not misrepresent or exaggerate their degree of responsibility in prior assignments nor the
complexity of said assignments. Presentations incidental to the solicitation of employment or business shall not
misrepresent pertinent facts concerning employers, employees, associates, joint ventures, or past accomplishments.
2. Licensees shall not offer, give, solicit, or receive, either directly or indirectly, any commission, or gift, or other
valuable consideration in order to secure work, and shall not make any political contribution with the intent to
influence the award of a contract by public authority.
3. Licensees shall not injure or attempt to injure, maliciously or falsely, directly or indirectly, the professional
reputation, prospects, practice, or employment of other licensees, nor indiscriminately criticize other licensees’
work.
4. Licensees shall make a reasonable effort to inform another licensee whose work is believed to contain a material
discrepancy, error, or omission that may impact the health, safety, or welfare of the public, unless such reporting is
legally prohibited.

Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is the creative product of the intellect and normally includes inventions, symbols, literary works,
patents, and designs.
A number of options are available to individuals who wish to protect their intellectual property from being claimed or
misused by others. There are four protection categories used to offer varying degrees of protection to intellectual property
owners: Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Trade Secrets.

Patents
A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed
in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of
maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions.
There are three types of patents:
• Utility patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, article of
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof;
• Design patents may be granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of
manufacture; and
• Plant patents may be granted to anyone who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety
of plant.

Trademarks
A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or device that is used in trade with goods to indicate the source of the goods and to
distinguish them from the goods of others. Trademark rights may be used to prevent others from using a confusingly similar
mark, but not to prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly
different mark.

Copyrights
A copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of "original works of authorship" including literary, dramatic,
musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished. The 1976 Copyright Act generally
gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to
distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work, to perform the copyrighted work publicly, or to display the
copyrighted work publicly.
11

Ethics and Professional Practice

Trade Secrets
A trade secret applies to a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process. To meet the most
common definition of a trade secret, it must be used in business and give an opportunity to obtain an economic advantage
over competitors who do not know or use it. Trade secrets offer little protection without a written agreement between the
involved parties.
United States Patent and Trademark Office, https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/general-information-concerning-patents#headings-2.

Societal Considerations
"Creating a sustainable world that provides a safe, secure, healthy life for all peoples is a priority of the US engineering
community. Engineers must deliver solutions that are technically viable, [economically] feasible, and environmentally and
socially sustainable."
Reddy, K.R., C. Cameselle, and J.A.A. Adams, Sustainable Engineering: Drivers, Metrics, Tools, and Applications, 1st ed., John Wiley & Sons, 2019.

Sustainable approaches during planning, design, and construction or manufacture will carry forward throughout a project’s
or product’s operation and maintenance to end-of-life. Sustainable principles include consideration of:
• Safety
• Public health
• Quality of life
• Resource allocation
• Non-renewable resources
Life-cycle analysis (cradle to grave) involves assessing the potential environmental consequences associated with a
project or product from design and development through utilization and disposal. Engineers must employ concern for
environmental health and public safety by addressing such things as:
• Landscape aesthetics
• Protection of ecosystems
• Resource conservation
• Air and water pollution
• Atmospheric emissions
• Collection and processing of waste

Safety
Definition of Safety
Safety is the condition of protecting people from threats or failures that could harm their physical, emotional, occupational,
psychological, or financial well-being. Safety is also the control of known threats to attain an acceptable level of risk.
The United States relies on public codes and standards, engineering designs, and corporate policies to ensure that a structure
or place does what it should do to maintain a steady state of safety—that is, long-term stability and reliability. Some Safety/
Regulatory Agencies that develop codes and standards commonly used in the United States are shown in the table.

Safety and Prevention
A traditional preventive approach to both accidents and occupational illness involves recognizing, evaluating, and controlling
hazards and work conditions that may cause physical or other injuries.
Hazard is the capacity to cause harm. It is an inherent quality of a material or a condition. For example, a rotating saw blade or
an uncontrolled high-pressure jet of water has the capability (hazard) to slice through flesh. A toxic chemical or a pathogen has
the capability (hazard) to cause illness.
Risk is the chance or probability that a person will experience harm and is not the same as a hazard. Risk always involves both
probability and severity elements. The hazard associated with a rotating saw blade or the water jet continues to exist, but the
probability of causing harm, and thus the risk, can be reduced by installing a guard or by controlling the jet's path. Risk is
expressed by the equation:
Risk = Hazard × Probability
When people discuss the hazards of disease-causing agents, the term exposure is typically used more than probability. If a certain
type of chemical has a toxicity hazard, the risk of illness rises with the degree to which that chemical contacts your body or enters
your lungs. In that case, the equation becomes:
Risk = Hazard × Exposure
Organizations evaluate hazards using multiple techniques and data sources.

Safety

Job Safety Analysis
Job safety analysis (JSA) is known by many names, including activity hazard analysis (AHA), or job hazard analysis (JHA).
Hazard analysis helps integrate accepted safety and health principles and practices into a specific task. In a JSA, each basic step
of the job is reviewed, potential hazards identified, and recommendations documented as to the safest way to do the job. JSA
techniques work well when used on a task that the analysts understand well. JSA analysts look for specific types of potential
accidents and ask basic questions about each step, such as these:
Can the employee strike against or otherwise make injurious contact with the object?
Can the employee be caught in, on, or between objects?
Can the employee strain muscles by pushing, pulling, or lifting?
Is exposure to toxic gases, vapors, dust, heat, electrical currents, or radiation possible?

GHS
The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, or GHS, is a system for standardizing and
harmonizing the classification and labeling of chemicals. GHS is a comprehensive approach to:
• Defining health, physical, and environmental hazards of chemicals
• Creating classification processes that use available data on chemicals for comparison with the defined hazard criteria
• Communicating hazard information, as well as protective measures, on labels and Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), formerly called
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).
GHS label elements include:
• Precautionary statements and pictograms: Measures to minimize or prevent adverse effects
• Product identifier (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS
• Supplier identification: The name, address, and telephone number of the supplier
• Supplemental information: nonharmonized information
Other label elements include symbols, signal words, and hazard statements.

Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
The SDS provides comprehensive information for use in workplace chemical management. Employers and workers use the SDS as a
source of information about hazards and to obtain advice on safety precautions. The SDS is product related and, usually, is not able to
provide information that is specific for any given workplace where the product may be used. However, the SDS information enables the
employer to develop an active program of worker protection measures, including training, which is specific to the individual workplace,
and to consider any measures that may be necessary to protect the environment. Information in an SDS also provides a source of
information for those involved with the transport of dangerous goods, emergency responders, poison centers, those involved with the
professional use of pesticides, and consumers.
The SDS has 16 sections in a set order, and minimum information is prescribed.
The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide SDSs to
communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products. As of June 1, 2015, the HCS requires new SDSs to be in a uniform format, and
include the section numbers, the headings, and associated information under the headings below:
Section 1, Identification: Includes product identifier; manufacturer or distributor name, address, phone number; emergency phone
number; recommended use; restrictions on use
Section 2, Hazard(s) identification: Includes all hazards regarding the chemical; required label elements
Section 3, Composition/information on ingredients: Includes information on chemical ingredients; trade secret claims
Section 4, First-aid measures: Includes important symptoms/effects, acute, and delayed; required treatment
Section 5, Fire-fighting measures: Lists suitable extinguishing techniques, equipment; chemical hazards from fire
Section 6, Accidental release measures: Lists emergency procedures; protective equipment; proper methods of containment and cleanup
Section 7, Handling and storage: Lists precautions for safe handling and storage, including incompatibilities
Section 8, Exposure controls/personal protection: Lists OSHA's Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs); Threshold Limit Values (TLVs);
appropriate engineering controls; personal protective equipment (PPE)
Section 9, Physical and chemical properties: Lists the chemical's characteristics
Section 10, Stability and reactivity: Lists chemical stability and possibility of hazardous reactions
Section 11, Toxicological information: Includes routes of exposure; related symptoms, acute and chronic effects; numerical measures of
toxicity
Section 12, Ecological information*
Section 13, Disposal considerations*
Section 14, Transport information*
Section 15, Regulatory information*
Section 16, Other information: Includes the date of preparation or last revision
*Note: Since other Agencies regulate this information, OSHA will not be enforcing Sections 12 through 15
(29 CFR 1910.1200(g)(2)).

Signal Words
The signal word found on every product's label is based on test results from various oral, dermal, and inhalation toxicity tests,
as well as skin and eye corrosion assays in some cases. Signal words are placed on labels to convey a level of care that should be
taken (especially personal protection) when handling and using a product, from purchase to disposal of the empty container, as
demonstrated by the Pesticide Toxicity Table.

Flammability
Flammable describes any solid, liquid, vapor, or gas that will ignite easily and burn rapidly. A flammable liquid is defined by NFPA
and USDOT as a liquid with a flash point below 100°F (38°C). Flammability is further defined with lower and upper limits:
LFL = lower flammability limit (volume % in air)
UFL = upper flammability limit (volume % in air)
The LFL is also known as the lower explosive limit (LEL). The UFL is also referred to as the upper explosive limit (UEL). There is
no difference between the terms flammable and explosive as applied to the lower and upper limits of flammability.
A vapor-air mixture will only ignite and burn over the range of concentrations between LFL and UFL. Examples are:
Gas/Compound
Acetone
Acetylene
Ammonia
n-butane
Carbon disulfide
Carbon monoxide
Cycloheptane
Cyclohexane
Cyclopropane
Diethyl ether

Safety
LOC, limiting oxygen concentration (vol % O2), is the concentration of oxygen below which combustion is not possible.
AIT, autoignition temperature, is the lowest temperature above which no external ignition source is required to initiate combustion.

Predicting Lower Flammable Limits of Mixtures of Flammable Gases (Le Chatelier's Rule)
Based on an empirical rule developed by Le Chatelier, the lower flammable limit of mixtures of multiple flammable gases in air
can be determined. A generalization of Le Chatelier's rule is
n

/ _Ci/LFLi i $ 1

i=1

where Ci is the volume percent of fuel gas, i, in the fuel/air mixture and LFLi is the volume percent of fuel gas, i, at its lower
flammable limit in air alone. If the indicated sum is greater than unity, the mixture is above the lower flammable limit. This can
be restated in terms of the lower flammable limit concentration of the fuel mixture, LFLm, as follows:
100
LFLm = n
/ _C fi/LFLi i
i=1

where Cfi is the volume percent of fuel gas i in the fuel gas mixture.

Granular Storage and Process Safety
Some materials that are not inherently hazardous can become hazardous during storage or processing. An example is the
handling of grain in grain bins. Grain bins should not be entered when the grain is being removed since grains flow to the center
of the emptying bin and create suffocation hazards. Bridging may occur at the top surface due to condensation and resulting
spoilage creating a crust.
Organic vapors and dusts associated with grain handling often contain toxic yeasts or molds and have low oxygen contents.
These organic vapors and dusts may also be explosive.

Confined Space Safety
Many workplaces contain spaces that are considered "confined" because their configurations hinder the activities of employees
who must enter, work in, and exit them. A confined space has limited or restricted means for entry or exit and is not designed
for continuous employee occupancy. Confined spaces include, but are not limited to, underground vaults, tanks, storage bins,
manholes, pits, silos, process vessels, and pipelines. OSHA uses the term "permit-required confined spaces" (permit space)
to describe a confined space that has one or more of the following characteristics: contains or has the potential to contain a
hazardous atmosphere; contains a material that has the potential to engulf an entrant; has walls that converge inward or floors
that slope downward and taper into a smaller area that could trap or asphyxiate an entrant; or contains any other recognized
safety or health hazard such as unguarded machinery, exposed live wires or heat stress.
Sensor placement in confined spaces should be based on constituent gas molecular weight relative to that of air and, where
applicable, source location.
OSHA has developed OSHA standards, directives (instructions for compliance officers), standard interpretations (official letters
of interpretation of the standards), and national consensus standards related to confined spaces. The following gases are often
present in confined spaces:
20

Safety
Ammonia: Irritating at 50 ppm and deadly above 1,000 ppm; sharp, cutting odor
Hydrogen sulfide: Irritating at 10 ppm and deadly at 500 ppm; accumulates at lower levels and in corners where circulation is
minimal; rotten egg odor
Methane: Explosive at levels above 50,000 ppm, lighter than air, odorless
Carbon dioxide: Heavier than air, accumulates at lower levels and in corners where circulation is minimal, displaces air leading
to asphyxiation

TOXIC RESPONSE (PERCENT)

The dose-response curve relates toxic response (i.e., percentage of test population exhibiting a specified symptom or dying) to the
logarithm of the dosage [i.e., mg/(kg•day) ingested]. A typical dose-response curve is shown below.

Carcinogens
For carcinogens, EPA considers an acceptable risk to be within the range of 10-4 to 10-6. The added risk of cancer is calculated as
follows:
Risk = dose # toxicity = CDI # CSF

The coefficient of friction µ and the angle α at which the floor is inclined determine the equations at the foot.
Fx = µFz
With the slope angle α
Fx = µFzcos α
Of course, when motion must be considered, dynamic conditions come into play according to Newton's Second Law. Force
transmitted with the hands is counteracted at the foot. Further, the body must also react with internal forces at all points between

Incidence Variable Values
Two concepts can be important when completing OSHA forms. These concepts are incidence rates and severity rates. On
occasion it is necessary to calculate the total injury/illness incident rate of an organization in order to complete OSHA forms.
This calculation must include fatalities and all injuries requiring medical treatment beyond mere first aid. The formula for
determining the total injury/illness incident rate is as follows:
IR = N × 200,000 ÷ T
where
IR = Total injury/illness incidence rate
N = Number of injuries, illnesses, and fatalities
T = Total hours worked by all employees during the period in question
The number 200,000 in the formula represents the number of hours 100 employees work in a year (40 hours per week × 50 weeks
= 2,000 hours per year per employee). Using the same basic formula with only minor substitutions, safety managers can calculate
the following types of incidence rates:
1. Injury rate
2. Illness rate
3. Fatality rate
4. Lost workday cases rate
5. Number of lost workdays rate
6. Specific hazard rate
7. Lost workday injuries rate

Note: D = 100% is equivalent to 90 dBA time-weighted average (TWA). D = 50% equivalent to TWA of 85 dBA.
Hearing conservation program requires: (1) testing employee hearing, (2) providing hearing protection at employee's request,
and (3) monitoring noise exposure.
Exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB sound pressure level (SPL).

Matrix of Relation
If A = {a1, a2, ..., am} and B = {b1, b2, ..., bn} are finite sets containing m and n elements, respectively, then a relation R from A
to B can be represented by the m × n matrix
MR < [mij], which is defined by:
mij = { 1 if (ai, bj) ∈ R
0 if (ai, bj) ∉ R}

Directed Graphs, or Digraphs, of Relation
A directed graph, or digraph, consists of a set V of vertices (or nodes) together with a set E of ordered pairs of elements
of V called edges (or arcs). For edge (a, b), the vertex a is called the initial vertex and vertex b is called the terminal vertex. An
edge of form (a, a) is called a loop.

Finite State Machine
A finite state machine consists of a finite set of states
Si = {s0, s1, ..., sn} and a finite set of inputs I; and a transition function f that assigns to each state and input pair a new state.
A state (or truth) table can be used to represent the finite state machine.

The characteristic of how a function maps one set (X) to another set (Y) may be described in terms of being either injective,
surjective, or bijective.
An injective (one-to-one) relationship exists if, and only if,
∀ x1, x2 ∈ X, if f (x1) = f (x2), then x1 = x2
A surjective (onto) relationship exists when ∀ y ∈ Y, ∃ x ∈ X such that f(x) = y
A bijective relationship is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

The general form of the equation is
Ax + By + C = 0
The standard form of the equation is
y = mx + b,
which is also known as the slope-intercept form.
The point-slope form is
y – y1 = m(x – x1)
Given two points: slope,
m = (y2 – y1)/(x2 – x1)
The angle between lines with slopes m1 and m2 is
α = arctan [(m2 – m1)/(1 + m2·m1)]
Two lines are perpendicular if m1 = –1/m2
The distance between two points is

Special definitions for b = e or b = 10 are:
ln x, Base = e

To change from one Base to another:
logb x = (loga x)/(loga b)
e.g., ln x = (log10 x)/(log10 e) = 2.302585 (log10 x)

Algebra of Complex Numbers
Complex numbers may be designated in rectangular form or polar form. In rectangular form, a complex number is written in
terms of its real and imaginary components.
z = a + jb
where
a = real component
b = imaginary component

(some disciplines use

)

In polar form z = c ∠ θ
where

= c sin θ

Complex numbers can be added and subtracted in rectangular form. If
z1 = a1 + jb1 = c1 (cos θ1 + jsin θ1) = c1 ∠ θ1 and
z2 = a2 + jb2 = c2 (cos θ2 + jsin θ2) = c2 ∠ θ2, then
z1 + z2 = (a1 + a2) + j (b1 + b2) and
z1 – z2 = (a1 – a2) + j (b1 – b2)
While complex numbers can be multiplied or divided in rectangular form, it is more convenient to perform these operations in
polar form.
z1 × z2 = (c1 × c2) ∠ (θ1 + θ2)
z1/z2 = (c1 /c2) ∠ (θ1 – θ2)
The complex conjugate of a complex number z1 = (a1 + jb1) is defined as z1* = (a1 – jb1). The product of a complex number and
its complex conjugate is z1z1* = a12 + b12.

The general form of the conic section equation is

where not both A and C are zero.
If B2 – 4AC < 0, an ellipse is defined.
If B2 – 4AC > 0, a hyperbola is defined.
If B2 – 4AC = 0, the conic is a parabola.
If A = C and B = 0, a circle is defined.
If A = B = C = 0, a straight line is defined.
x2 + y2 + 2ax + 2by + c = 0
is the normal form of the conic section equation, if that conic section has a principal axis parallel to a coordinate axis.

y = f (x) has a point of inflection at x = a,
if f ″(a) = 0, and
if f ″(x) changes sign as x increases through

The Partial Derivative
In a function of two independent variables x and y, a derivative with respect to one of the variables may be found if the other
variable is assumed to remain constant. If y is kept fixed, the function
z = f (x, y)
becomes a function of the single variable x, and its derivative (if it exists) can be found. This derivative is called the partial
derivative of z with respect to x. The partial derivative with respect to x is denoted as follows:

Progression and Series
Arithmetic Progression
To determine whether a given finite sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression, subtract each number from the following
number. If the differences are equal, the series is arithmetic.
1. The first term is a.
2. The common difference is d.
3. The number of terms is n.
4. The last or nth term is l.
5. The sum of n terms is S.
l = a + (n – 1)d
S = n(a + l)/2 = n [2a + (n – 1) d]/2

Geometric Progression
To determine whether a given finite sequence is a geometric progression (G.P.), divide each number after the first by the
preceding number. If the quotients are equal, the series is geometric:
1. The first term is a.
2. The common ratio is r.
3. The number of terms is n.
4. The last or nth term is l.
5. The sum of n terms is S.
l = arn−1
S = a (1 – rn)/(1 – r); r ≠1
S = (a – rl)/(1 – r); r ≠1
limit Sn= a/(1 − r); r < 1
n→∞

A G.P. converges if |r| < 1 and it diverges if |r| > 1.

1. A power series, which is convergent in the interval –R < x < R, defines a function of x that is continuous for all values of x
within the interval and is said to represent the function in that interval.
2. A power series may be differentiated term by term within its interval of convergence. The resulting series has the same
interval of convergence as the original series (except possibly at the end points of the series).
3. A power series may be integrated term by term provided the limits of integration are within the interval of convergence of
the series.
4. Two power series may be added, subtracted, or multiplied, and the resulting series in each case is convergent, at least, in the
interval common to the two series.
5. Using the process of long division (as for polynomials), two power series may be divided one by the other within their
common interval of convergence.

is called Taylor's series, and the function f (x) is said to be expanded about the point a in a Taylor's series.
If a = 0, the Taylor's series equation becomes a Maclaurin's series.

Differential Equations
A common class of ordinary linear differential equations is

dy ^ xh
+ b0 y ^ xh = f ^ xh
+ f + b1
n
dx
dx

bn

where bn, … , bi, … , b1, b0 are constants.
When the equation is a homogeneous differential equation, f(x) = 0, the solution is
yh ^ xh = C1e r1 x + C2e r 2 x + f + Cie r i x + f + Cne r n x

where rn is the nth distinct root of the characteristic polynomial P(x) with
P(r) = bnrn + bn–1rn–1 + … + b1r + b0
If the root r1 = r2, then C2er2 x is replaced with C2xer1x.
Higher orders of multiplicity imply higher powers of x. The complete solution for the differential equation is
y(x) = yh(x) + yp(x),
where yp(x) is any particular solution with f(x) present. If f(x) has ern x terms, then resonance is manifested.
Furthermore, specific f(x) forms result in specific yp(x) forms, some of which are:
yp(x)

Second-Order Linear Homogeneous Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients
An equation of the form
y″+ ay′+ by = 0
can be solved by the method of undetermined coefficients where a solution of the form y = Cerx is sought. Substitution of this
solution gives
(r2 + ar + b) Cerx = 0
and since Cerx cannot be zero, the characteristic equation must vanish or
r2 + ar + b = 0
The roots of the characteristic equation are

and can be real and distinct for a2 > 4b, real and equal for a2 = 4b, and complex for a2 < 4b.
If a2 > 4b, the solution is of the form (overdamped)
y = C1er1x + C2er2 x

If a = 4b, the solution is of the form (critically damped)
y = (C1+ C2x)er1x
If a < 4b, the solution is of the form (underdamped)
y = eαx (C1 cos βx + C2 sin βx), where

Fourier Series

Every periodic function f(t) which has the period T = 2π/ω0 and has certain continuity conditions can be represented by a series
plus a constant
f ^ t h = a0 + / 8an cos _n~0t i + bn sin _n~0t iB
3

n=1

The above holds if f(t) has a continuous derivative f ′(t) for
all t. It should be noted that the various sinusoids present in the series are orthogonal on the interval 0 to T and as a result the
coefficients are given by
a0 = _1 T i #0T f ^ t h dt

an = _2 T i #0T f ^ t h cos _n~0t i dt

bn = _2

T i #0T f ^ t h sin _ n~0t i dt

n = 1, 2, f
n = 1, 2, f

The constants an and bn are the Fourier coefficients of f(t) for the interval 0 to T and the corresponding series is called the
Fourier series of f(t) over the same interval.
The integrals have the same value when evaluated over any interval of length T.
If a Fourier series representing a periodic function is truncated after term n = N, the mean square value FN2 of the truncated
series is given by Parseval's relation. This relation says that the mean-square value is the sum of the mean-square values of the
Fourier components, or
FN2 = a 0 + _1 2i ! ` an2 + bn2j

n= 1

and the RMS value is then defined to be the square root of this quantity or FN.

Determinants
A determinant of order n consists of n2 numbers, called the elements of the determinant, arranged in n rows and n columns and
enclosed by two vertical lines.
In any determinant, the minor of a given element is the determinant that remains after all of the elements are struck out that lie
in the same row and in the same column as the given element. Consider an element which lies in the jth column and the ith row.
The cofactor of this element is the value of the minor of the element (if i + j is even), and it is the negative of the value of the
minor of the element (if i + j is odd).
If n is greater than 1, the value of a determinant of order n is the sum of the n products formed by multiplying each element of
some specified row (or column) by its cofactor. This sum is called the expansion of the determinant [according to the elements
of the specified row (or column)]. For a second-order determinant:
a1 a2
b1 b2

= a1b2 − a2b1

For a third-order determinant:
a1 a2 a3
b1 b2 b3 = a1b2c3 + a2b3c1 + a3b1c2 - a3b2c1 - a2b1c3 - a1b3c2

Addition and subtraction:
A + B = (ax + bx)i + (ay + by)j + (az + bz)k
A – B = (ax – bx)i + (ay – by)j + (az – bz)k
The dot product is a scalar product and represents the projection of B onto A times A . It is given by
A•B = axbx + ayby + azbz = A B cos i = B : A
The cross product is a vector product of magnitude B A sin θ which is perpendicular to the plane containing A and B. The

Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations
Euler's Approximation
Given a differential equation
dx/dt = f (x, t) with x(0) = xo
At some general time k∆t
x[(k + 1)∆t] ≅ x(k∆t) + ∆tf [x(k∆t), k∆t]
which can be used with starting condition xo to solve recursively for x(∆t), x(2∆t), …, x(n∆t).
The method can be extended to nth order differential equations by recasting them as n first-order equations.
In particular, when dx/dt = f (x)
x[(k + 1)∆t] ≅ x(k∆t) + ∆tf [x(k∆t)]
which can be expressed as the recursive equation
xk + 1 = xk + ∆t (dxk /dt)

xk + 1 = x + ∆t [f (x(k), t(k))]

Laws of Probability

Property 1. General Character of Probability
The probability P(E) of an event E is a real number in the range of 0 to 1. The probability of an impossible event is 0 and that of
an event certain to occur is 1.

Property 2. Law of Total Probability
P(A + B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A, B)
where
P(A + B) = the probability that either A or B occur alone or that both occur together
P(A)
= the probability that A occurs
P(B)
= the probability that B occurs
P(A, B) = the probability that both A and B occur simultaneously

Property 3. Law of Compound or Joint Probability
If neither P(A) nor P(B) is zero,
P(A, B) = P(A)P(B | A) = P(B)P(A | B)
where
P(B | A) = the probability that B occurs given the fact that A has occurred
P(A | B) = the probability that A occurs given the fact that B has occurred
If either P(A) or P(B) is zero, then P(A, B) = 0.

Probability Functions, Distributions, and Expected Values
A random variable X has a probability associated with each of its possible values. The probability is termed a discrete
probability if X can assume only discrete values, or
X = x1, x2, x3, …, xn
The discrete probability of any single event, X = xi, occurring is defined as P(xi) while the probability mass function of the
random variable X is defined by
f (xk) = P(X = xk), k = 1, 2, ..., n

Probability Density Function
If X is continuous, the probability density function, f, is defined such that
b

P ^ a # X # bh = # f ^ xh dx
a

Cumulative Distribution Functions
The cumulative distribution function, F, of a discrete random variable X that has a probability distribution described by P(xi) is
defined as
m

F _ xmi = ! P _ xk i = P _ X # xmi, m = 1, 2, f, n
k= 1

If X is continuous, the cumulative distribution function, F, is defined by
x

F ^xh = # f ^xh dx
−3

which implies that F(a) is the probability that X ≤ a.

Expected Values
Let X be a discrete random variable having a probability
mass function
f (xk), k = 1, 2,..., n

The coefficient of variation is defined as σ/μ.

Combinations of Random Variables
Y = a1 X1 + a2 X2 + …+ an Xn
The expected value of Y is:
µ y = E ^Y h = a1 E _ X1 i + a 2 E _ X 2 i + f + a n E _ X n i

If the random variables are statistically independent, then the variance of Y is:
σ 2y = V ^Y h = a12 V _ X1 i + a 22 V _ X 2 i + f + a n2 V _ X n i
= a12 σ12 + a 22 σ 22 + f + a n2 σ 2n

Also, the standard deviation of Y is:

When Y = f(X1, X2,.., Xn) and Xi are independent, the standard deviation of Y is expressed as:

Binomial Distribution

The variance is given by the form:
σ2 = npq

Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
This is a unimodal distribution, the mode being x = µ, with two points of inflection (each located at a distance σ to either side
of the mode). The averages of n observations tend to become normally distributed as n increases. The variate x is said to be
normally distributed if its density function f (x) is given by an expression of the form
f^ xh =

When µ = 0 and σ2 = σ = 1, the distribution is called a standardized or unit normal distribution. Then

A unit normal distribution table is included at the end of this section. In the table, the following notations are utilized:
F(x) = area under the curve from –∞ to x
R(x) = area under the curve from x to ∞
W(x) = area under the curve between –x and x
F(-x) = 1 - F(x)
It should be noted that for any normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ, the table for the unit normal
distribution can be used by utilizing the following transformation:
z=

x−µ
σ

f(x) then becomes f(z), F(x) becomes F(z), etc.
The Central Limit Theorem
Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables each having mean µ and variance
σ2. Then for large n, the Central Limit Theorem asserts that the sum
Y = X1 + X2 + ... Xn is approximately normal.
µy = µ

Propagation of Error
Measurement Error
Measurement error is defined as: Measured quantity value minus a reference quantity value. [Source: ISO JCGM 200:2012
definition 2.16]
Sources of errors in measurements arise from imperfections and disturbances in the measurement process, and added noise. One
may model a measurement as:
x = xref + dsystematic + drandom
where x is the measurand (value being measured), xref is the reference value, dsystematic is a disturbance from the measurement
process such as a drift or bias, and drandom is a disturbance such as random noise.

Linear Combinations
In mathematics, a linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant
and adding the results (e.g., if z is a linear combination of x and y, then z = ax+by where a and b are constants).
See the section "Combinations of Random Variables" for how variances and standard deviations of random variables combine.

Measurement Uncertainty
Measurement uncertainty is defined as: A quantitative estimate of the range of values about the reported or measured value in
which the true value is believed to lie. [Source: ISO JCGM 200:2012, definition 2.26]
Given a desired state or measurement y, which is a function of different measured or available states xi:
y = f(x1, x2,…, xn)
Given the individual states xi and their standard deviations σx , and assuming that the different xi are uncorrelated, the
i
Kline-McClintock equation can be used to compute the expected standard uncertainty of y (σy) is:

Expanded uncertainties are typically given at an approximately 95% level of confidence with a coverage factor of k = 2.
This represents 95% of the area under a Normal probability distribution and is often called 2 sigma.

Consider an unknown parameter θ of a statistical distribution. Let the null hypothesis be
H0: m = m0
and let the alternative hypothesis be
H1: m ≠ m0
Rejecting H0 when it is true is known as a Type I error, while accepting H0 when it is wrong is known as a Type II error.
Furthermore, the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are usually represented by the symbols α and β, respectively:
α = probability (Type I error)
β = probability (Type II error)
The probability of a Type I error is known as the level of significance of the test.

Definitions
Avogadro's Number – The number of elementary particles in a mol of a substance.
1 mol = 1 gram mole
1 mol = 6.02 × 1023 particles
Molarity of Solutions – The number of gram moles of a substance dissolved in a liter of solution.
Molality of Solutions – The number of gram moles of a substance per 1,000 grams of solvent.
Normality of Solutions – The product of the molarity of a solution and the number of valence changes taking place in
a reaction.
Molar Volume of an Ideal Gas [at 0°C (32°F) and 1 atm (14.7 psia)]; 22.4 L/(g mole) [359 ft3/(lb mole)].

Heats of Reaction, Solution, Formation, and Combustion – Chemical processes generally involve the absorption or evolution
of heat. In an endothermic process, heat is absorbed (enthalpy change is positive). In an exothermic process, heat is evolved
(enthalpy change is negative).
Solubility Product of a slightly soluble substance AB:
AmBn → mAn+ + nBm–
Solubility Product Constant = KSP = [A+]m [B–]n
Faraday's Equation
Q M
m = c F ma z k
where

m = mass (grams) of substance liberated at electrode
Q = total electric charge passed through electrolyte (coulomb or ampere•second)
F = 96,485 coulombs/mol
M = molar mass of the substance (g/mol)
z = valence number
A catalyst is a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction. The catalyst does not affect the position of equilibrium of a
reversible reaction.
The atomic number is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus.
Boiling Point Elevation – The presence of a nonvolatile solute in a solvent raises the boiling point of the resulting solution.
Freezing Point Depression – The presence of a solute lowers the freezing point of the resulting solution.

For the above conditions, one finds that:
a = 1.94
b = 0.77
c = 3.88
d = 2.13
e = 3.68
The c coefficient represents a theoretical maximum yield coefficient, which may be reduced by a yield factor.
The respiratory quotient (RQ) is a dimensionless number used in calculations of basal metabolic rate when estimated from the
ratio of CO2 produced to the O2 consumed. The RQ depends on substrates and organisms involved.

Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is a most important process form synthesizing glucose from carbon dioxide. It also produces oxygen. The most
important photosynthesis reaction is summarized as follows.
6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2
The light is required to be in the 400- to 700-nm range (visible light). Chlorophyll is the primary photosynthesis compound and
it is found in organisms ranging from tree and plant leaves to single celled algae.

Selected Rules of Nomenclature in Organic Chemistry
Alcohols
Three systems of nomenclature are in general use. In the first, the alkyl group attached to the hydroxyl group is named and
the separate word alcohol is added. In the second system, the higher alcohols are considered as derivatives of the first member
of the series, which is called carbinol. The third method is the modified Geneva system in which (1) the longest carbon chain
containing the hydroxyl group determines the surname, (2) the ending e of the corresponding saturated hydrocarbon is replaced
by ol, (3) the carbon chain is numbered from the end that gives the hydroxyl group the smaller number, and (4) the side chains
are named and their positions indicated by the proper number. Alcohols in general are divided into three classes. In primary
alcohols the hydroxyl group is united to a primary carbon atom, that is, a carbon atom united directly to only one other carbon
atom. Secondary alcohols have the hydroxyl group united to a secondary carbon atom, that is, one united to two other carbon
atoms. Tertiary alcohols have the hydroxyl group united to a tertiary carbon atom, that is, one united to three other carbon
atoms.

Ethers
Ethers are generally designated by naming the alkyl groups and adding the word ether. The group RO is known as an
alkoxyl group. Ethers may also be named as alkoxy derivatives of hydrocarbons.

Carboxylic Acids
The name of each linear carboxylic acid is unique to the number of carbon atoms it contains. 1: (one carbon atom) Formic.
2: Acetic. 3: Propionic. 4: Butyric. 5: Valeric. 6: Caproic. 7: Enanthic. 8: Caprylic. 9: Pelargonic. 10: Capric.

Aldehydes
The common names of aldehydes are derived from the acids that would be formed on oxidation, that is, the acids having the
same number of carbon atoms. In general the ic acid is dropped and aldehyde added.

Ketones
The common names of ketones are derived from the acid which on pyrolysis would yield the ketone. A second method,
especially useful for naming mixed ketones, simply names the alkyl groups and adds the word ketone. The name is written as
three separate words.

Unsaturated Acyclic Hydrocarbons
The simplest compounds in this class of hydrocarbon chemicals are olefins or alkenes with a single carbon-carbon double bond,
having the general formula of CnH2n. The simplest example in this category is ethylene, C2H4.
Dienes are acyclic hydrocarbons with two carbon-carbon double bonds, having the general formula of CnH2n–2; butadiene
(C4H6) is an example of such.
Similarly, trienes have three carbon-carbon double bonds with the general formula of CnH2n–4; hexatriene (C6H8) is such
an example.
The simplest alkynes have a single carbon-carbon triple bond with the general formula of CnH2n–2. This series of compounds
begins with acetylene, or C2H2.

Corrosion
A table listing the standard electromotive potentials of metals is shown in the previous section.
For corrosion to occur, there must be an anode and a cathode in electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte.

Anode Reaction (Oxidation) of a Typical Metal, M
Mo → Mn+ + ne–

Possible Cathode Reactions (Reduction)
½ O2 + 2 e– + H2O → 2 OH–
½ O2 + 2 e– + 2 H3O+ → 3 H2O
2 e– + 2 H3O+ → 2 H2O + H2
When dissimilar metals are in contact, the more electropositive one becomes the anode in a corrosion cell. Different regions of
carbon steel can also result in a corrosion reaction: e.g., cold-worked regions are anodic to noncold-worked; different oxygen
concentrations can cause oxygen-deficient regions to become cathodic to oxygen-rich regions; grain boundary regions are
anodic to bulk grain; in multiphase alloys, various phases may not have the same galvanic potential.

Diffusion
Diffusion Coefficient
D = Do e−Q/(RT)
where

D = diffusion coefficient
Do = proportionality constant
Q = activation energy
R = gas constant [8.314 J/(mol•K)]
T = absolute temperature

Thermal and Mechanical Processing
Cold working (plastically deforming) a metal increases strength and lowers ductility.
Raising temperature causes (1) recovery (stress relief), (2) recrystallization, and (3) grain growth. Hot working allows these
processes to occur simultaneously with deformation.
Quenching is rapid cooling from elevated temperature, preventing the formation of equilibrium phases.
In steels, quenching austenite [FCC (γ) iron] can result in martensite instead of equilibrium phases—ferrite [BCC (α) iron] and
cementite (iron carbide).

Stress is defined as force per unit area; for pure tension the following apply:
Engineering stress
F
σ= A

0

where

σ = engineering stress
F = applied force
A0 = initial cross-sectional area

True stress
where

F
σT = A
σT = true stress
F = applied force
A = actual cross-sectional area

The elastic modulus (also called modulus, modulus of elasticity, Young's modulus) describes the relationship between
engineering stress and engineering strain during elastic loading. Hooke's Law applies in such a case.
σ

= Eε

where E = elastic modulus
Key mechanical properties obtained from a tensile test curve:
• Elastic modulus
• Ductility (also called percent elongation): Permanent engineering strain after failure
• Ultimate tensile strength (also called tensile strength): Maximum engineering stress
• Yield strength: Engineering stress at which permanent deformation is first observed, calculated by 0.2% offset method.
Other mechanical properties:
• Creep: Time-dependent deformation under load. Usually measured by strain rate. For steady-state creep this is:

where

Q
df =
n − RT
dt Av e

A = pre-exponential constant
n = stress sensitivity
Q = activation energy for creep
R = ideal gas law constant
T = absolute temperature
• Fatigue: Time-dependent failure under cyclic load. Fatigue life is the number of cycles to failure. The endurance limit is 		
the stress below which fatigue failure is unlikely.

Water-cement (W/C) ratio is the primary factor affecting the strength of concrete. The figure above shows how W/C expressed
as a ratio of weight of water and cement by weight of concrete mix affects the compressive strength of both air-entrained and
non-air-entrained concrete.

Merritt, Frederick S., Standard Handbook for Civil Engineers, 3rd ed., McGraw-Hill, 1983.

Water content affects workability. However, an increase in water without a corresponding increase in cement reduces the
concrete strength. Superplasticizers are the most typical way to increase workability. Air entrainment is used to improve
durability.

Polymer Additives
Chemicals and compounds are added to polymers to improve properties for commercial use. These substances, such as
plasticizers, improve formability during processing, while others increase strength or durability.
Examples of common additives are:
Plasticizers: vegetable oils, low molecular weight polymers or monomers
Fillers: talc, chopped glass fibers
Flame retardants: halogenated paraffins, zinc borate, chlorinated phosphates
Ultraviolet or visible light resistance: carbon black
Oxidation resistance: phenols, aldehydes

where

α = thermal expansion coefficient

Materials Science/Structure of Matter
Specific heat (also called heat capacity) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of something or an amount of
something by 1 degree.
At constant pressure the amount of heat (Q) required to increase the temperature of something by ∆T is Cp∆T, where Cp is the
constant pressure heat capacity.
At constant volume the amount of heat (Q) required to increase the temperature of something by ∆T is Cv∆T, where Cv is the
constant volume heat capacity.
An object can have a heat capacity that would be expressed as energy/degree.
The heat capacity of a material can be reported as energy/degree per unit mass or per unit volume.

Statics
Force (Two Dimensions)
A force is a vector quantity. It is defined when its (1) magnitude, (2) point of application, and (3) direction are known.
The vector form of a force is
F = Fx i + Fy j

Resolution of a Force
Fx = F cos θx

Fy = F cos θy

Fz = F cos θz

cos θx = Fx /F

cos θy = Fy /F

cos θz = Fz /F

Separating a force into components when the geometry of force is known and
Fx = (x/R)F

Fy = (y/R)F

Fz = (z/R)F

Moments (Couples)
A system of two forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and parallel to each other is called a couple. A moment
M is defined as the cross product of the radius vector r and the force F from a point to the line of action of the force.
M=r×F

Mx = yFz – zFy
My = zFx – xFz
Mz = xFy – yFx

Systems of Forces
F = Σ Fn
M = Σ (rn × Fn)

Equilibrium Requirements
Σ Fn = 0
Σ Mn = 0

Statics

Centroids of Masses, Areas, Lengths, and Volumes
The following formulas are for discrete masses, areas, lengths, and volumes:
rc = Σ mnrn /Σ mn
where

mn = mass of each particle making up the system
rn = radius vector to each particle from a selected reference point
rc = radius vector to the centroid of the total mass from the selected reference point

The moment of area (Ma) is defined as
May = Σ xnan
Max = Σ ynan
The centroid of area is defined as
xac = May /A = Σ xn an/A
yac = Max /A = Σ yn an/A
where A

= Σ an

The following equations are for an area, bounded by the axes and the function y = f(x). The centroid of area is defined as
# xdA
A
# ydA
yc =
A
A = # f ^ xh dx

xc =

dA = f ^ xh dx = g _ y i dy
The first moment of area with respect to the y-axis and the x-axis, respectively, are:
My = ∫x dA = xc A
Mx = ∫y dA = yc A

Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia, or the second moment of area, is defined as
Iy = ∫x2 dA
Ix = ∫y2 dA
The polar moment of inertia J of an area about a point is equal to the sum of the moments of inertia of the area about any two
perpendicular axes in the area and passing through the same point.
Iz = J = Iy + Ix = ∫(x2 + y2) dA
= rp2A
where rp = the radius of gyration (as defined below)

108

Statics
Moment of Inertia Parallel Axis Theorem
The moment of inertia of an area about any axis is defined as the moment of inertia of the area about a parallel centroidal axis
plus a term equal to the area multiplied by the square of the perpendicular distance d from the centroidal axis to the axis in
question.
Ix = Ixc + d 2y A
Iy = Iyc + d x2 A
where

Ixc, Iyc

Radius of Gyration
The radius of gyration rp, rx, ry is the distance from a reference axis at which all of the area can be considered to be concentrated
to produce the moment of inertia.

Product of Inertia
The product of inertia (Ixy, etc.) is defined as:
Ixy = ∫xydA, with respect to the xy-coordinate system
The parallel-axis theorem also applies:
I'xy = Ixc yc + dxdy A for the xy-coordinate system, etc.
where

dx = x-axis distance between the two axes in question
dy = y-axis distance between the two axes in question

Statics

Friction
The largest frictional force is called the limiting friction.
Any further increase in applied forces will cause motion.
F ≤ µs N
where

F = friction force
µs = coefficient of static friction
N = normal force between surfaces in contact

Screw Thread
For a screw-jack, square thread,
M = Pr tan (α ± φ)
where

+ is for screw tightening
– is for screw loosening
M = external moment applied to axis of screw
P = load on jack applied along and on the line of the axis
r = mean thread radius
α = pitch angle of the thread
µ = tan φ = appropriate coefficient of friction

Belt Friction
where

F1 = F2 eµθ
F1
F2
µ
θ

= force being applied in the direction of impending motion
= force applied to resist impending motion
= coefficient of static friction
= total angle of contact between the surfaces expressed in radians

Statically Determinate Truss
Plane Truss: Method of Joints
The method consists of solving for the forces in the members by writing the two equilibrium equations for each joint
of the truss.
Σ FH = 0 and Σ FV = 0
where
FH = horizontal forces and member components
FV = vertical forces and member components

Plane Truss: Method of Sections
The method consists of drawing a free-body diagram of a portion of the truss in such a way that the unknown truss member
force is exposed as an external force.

Concurrent Forces
A concurrent-force system is one in which the lines of action of the applied forces all meet at one point.
A two-force body in static equilibrium has two applied forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear.

Constant Acceleration
The equations for the velocity and displacement when acceleration is a constant are given as
a(t) = a0
v(t) = a0 (t – t0) + v0
s(t) = a0 (t – t0)2/2 + v0 (t – t0) + s0
where
s = displacement at time t, along the line of travel
s0 = displacement at time t0
v = velocity along the direction of travel
v0 = velocity at time t0
a0 = constant acceleration
t = time
t0 = some initial time
For a free-falling body, a0 = g (downward towards earth).
An additional equation for velocity as a function of position may be written as
v 2 = v02 + 2a0 _ s - s0i

For constant angular acceleration, the equations for angular velocity and displacement are
a ^ t h = a0

For constant mass,

One-Dimensional Motion of a Particle (Constant Mass)
When motion exists only in a single dimension then, without loss of generality, it may be assumed to be in the x direction, and
ax = Fx /m
where Fx = the resultant of the applied forces, which in general can depend on t, x, and vx.
If Fx only depends on t, then

Principle of Work and Energy
If Ti and Vi are, respectively, the kinetic and potential energy of a particle at state i, then for conservative systems (no energy
dissipation or gain), the law of conservation of energy is
T2 + V2 = T1 + V1
If nonconservative forces are present, then the work done by these forces must be accounted for. Hence
T2 + V2 = T1 + V1 + U1→2 , where
U1→2 = the work done by the nonconservative forces in moving between state 1 and state 2. Care must be exercised during
computations to correctly compute the algebraic sign of the work term. If the forces serve to increase the energy of the system,
U1→2 is positive. If the forces, such as friction, serve to dissipate energy, U1→2 is negative.

Impulse and Momentum
Linear Momentum
Assuming constant mass, the equation of motion of a particle may be written as
mdv/dt = F
mdv = Fdt
For a system of particles, by integrating and summing over the number of particles, this may be expanded to
t2

Rmi ^viht 2 = Rmi ^viht1 + R # Fi dt
t1

The term on the left side of the equation is the linear momentum of a system of particles at time t2. The first term on the right
side of the equation is the linear momentum of a system of particles at time t1. The second term on the right side of the equation
is the impulse of the force F from time t1 to t2. It should be noted that the above equation is a vector equation. Component scalar
equations may be obtained by considering the momentum and force in a set of orthogonal directions.

Angular Momentum or Moment of Momentum
The angular momentum or the moment of momentum about point 0 for a particle is defined as
H0 = r # mv, or
H0 = I0 ~
Taking the time derivative of the above, the equation of motion may be written as
Ho 0 = d _ I0 ~ i /dt = M0

where M0 is the moment applied to the particle. Now by integrating and summing over a system of any number of particles, this
may be expanded to
t2

Σ _H0i it2 = Σ _H0i it1 + Σ # M0idt
t1

The term on the left side of the equation is the angular momentum of a system of particles at time t2. The first term on the
right side of the equation is the angular momentum of a system of particles at time t1. The second term on the right side of the
equation is the angular impulse of the moment M0 from time t1 to t2.

Impact
During an impact, momentum is conserved while energy may or may not be conserved. For direct central impact with no
external forces
m1v1 + m2v2 = m1vl1 + m2vl2
where

m1, m2 = masses of the two bodies
v1, v2
= velocities of the bodies just before impact
v l1, v l2 = velocities of the bodies just after impact

For impacts, the relative velocity expression is
e=
where

_vl2 in − _vl1 in
_v1 in − _v2 in

e
= coefficient of restitution
(vi)n = velocity normal to the plane of impact just before impact
_ v li in = velocity normal to the plane of impact just after impact
121

Dynamics
The value of e is such that
0 ≤ e ≤ 1, with limiting values
e = 1, perfectly elastic (energy conserved)
e = 0, perfectly plastic (no rebound)
Knowing the value of e, the velocities after the impact are given as
m2 ^v2hn ^1 + eh + ^m1 - em2h ^v1hn
m1 + m2
m1 ^v1hn ^1 + eh - ^em1 - m2h ^v2hn
^v l2hn =

Friction
The Laws of Friction are
1. The total friction force F that can be developed is independent of the magnitude of the area of contact.
2. The total friction force F that can be developed is proportional to the normal force N.
3. For low velocities of sliding, the total frictional force that can be developed is practically independent of the sliding
velocity, although experiments show that the force F necessary to initiate slip is greater than that necessary to maintain
the motion.
The formula expressing the Laws of Friction is
F ≤ µN
where µ = the coefficient of friction.
In general
F < µs N, no slip occurring
F = µs N, at the point of impending slip
F = µk N, when slip is occurring
Here,

µs = coefficient of static friction
µk = coefficient of kinetic friction

The figure shows a fourbar slider-crank. Link 2 (the crank) rotates about the fixed center, O2. Link 3 couples the crank to the
slider (link 4), which slides against ground (link 1). Using the definition of an instant center (IC), we see that the pins at O2, A,
and B are ICs that are designated I12, I23, and I34. The easily observable IC is I14, which is located at infinity with its direction
perpendicular to the interface between links 1 and 4 (the direction of sliding). To locate the remaining two ICs (for a fourbar) we
must make use of Kennedy's rule.
Kennedy's Rule: When three bodies move relative to one another they have three instantaneous centers, all of which lie on the
same straight line.
To apply this rule to the slider-crank mechanism, consider links 1, 2, and 3 whose ICs are I12, I23, and I13, all of which lie on a
straight line. Consider also links 1, 3, and 4 whose ICs are I13, I34, and I14, all of which lie on a straight line. Extending the line
through I12 and I23 and the line through I34 and I14 to their intersection locates I13, which is common to the two groups of links
that were considered.

Kinetics of a Rigid Body
In general, Newton's second law for a rigid body, with constant mass and mass moment of inertia, in plane motion may be
written in vector form as
ΣF = mac
ΣMc = Ic a
ΣM p = Ic a + t pc # mac
where F are forces and ac is the acceleration of the body's mass center both in the plane of motion, Mc are moments and α is the
angular acceleration both about an axis normal to the plane of motion, Ic is the mass moment of inertia about the normal axis
through the mass center, and ρpc is a vector from point p to point c.

Parallel-Axis Theorem
The mass moments of inertia may be calculated about any axis through the application of the above definitions. However, once
the moments of inertia have been determined about an axis passing through a body's mass center, it may be transformed to

If the externally applied force is 0, this is a free vibration, and the motion of x is solved as the solution to a homogeneous
ordinary differential equation.
In a forced vibration system, the externally applied force F is typically periodic (for example, F = F0 sin ωt). The solution is the
sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.
For forced vibrations, one is typically interested in the steady state behavior (i.e. a long time after the system has started), which
is the particular solution.
For F = F0 sin ωt, the particular solution is:

Principal Stresses
For the special case of a two-dimensional stress state, the equations for principal stress reduce to

The two nonzero values calculated from this equation are temporarily labeled σa and σb and the third value σc is always zero in
this case. Depending on their values, the three roots are then labeled according to the convention:
algebraically largest = σ1, algebraically smallest = σ3, other = σ2. A typical 2D stress element is shown below with all

Mohr's Circle—Stress, 2D
To construct a Mohr's circle, the following sign conventions are used.
1. Tensile normal stress components are plotted on the horizontal axis and are considered positive. Compressive normal stress
components are negative.
2. For constructing Mohr's circle only, shearing stresses are plotted above the normal stress axis when the pair of shearing
stresses, acting on opposite and parallel faces of an element, forms a clockwise couple. Shearing stresses are plotted below
the normal axis when the shear stresses form a counterclockwise couple.

The maximum inplane shear stress is τin = R. However, the maximum shear stress considering three dimensions is always
σ −σ
τmax = 1 2 3 .

Hooke's Law
Three-dimensional case:
εx = (1/E)[σx – v(σy+ σz)]

γxy = τxy /G

εy = (1/E)[σy – v(σz+ σx)]

γyz = τyz /G

εz = (1/E)[σz – v(σx+ σy)]

γzx = τzx /G

Plane stress case (σz = 0):
εx = (1/E)(σx – vσy)
εy = (1/E)(σy – vσx)
εz = – (1/E)(vσx + vσy)

When there is a temperature change from an initial temperature Ti to a final temperature Tf there are also thermally-induced
normal strains. In this case, εx, εy, and εz require modification. Thus,

where J = polar moment of inertia

Torsional Strain

czz = limit r ^Dz/Dz h = r ^dz/dz h
Dz " 0

The shear strain varies in direct proportion to the radius, from zero strain at the center to the greatest strain at the outside of the
shaft. dφ/dz is the twist per unit length or the rate of twist.

Beams
Shearing Force and Bending Moment Sign Conventions
1. The bending moment is positive if it produces bending of the beam concave upward (compression in top fibers and tension
in bottom fibers).
2. The shearing force is positive if the right portion of the beam tends to shear downward with respect to the left.

Stresses in Beams

slope).
EI (dy/dx) = ∫M(x) dx

EIy = ∫[ ∫M(x) dx] dx
The constants of integration can be determined from the physical geometry of the beam.

Composite Sections
The bending stresses in a beam composed of dissimilar materials (Material 1 and Material 2) where E1 > E2 are:

where

σ1 = -nMy/IT
σ2 = -My/IT

Mechanics of Materials
E1 = elastic modulus of Material 1
E2 = elastic modulus of Material 2

The composite section is transformed into a section composed of a single material. The centroid and then the moment of inertia
are found on the transformed section for use in the bending stress equations.

Elastic Strain Energy
If the strain remains within the elastic limit, the work done during deflection (extension) of a member will be transformed into
potential energy and can be recovered.
If the final load is P and the corresponding elongation of a tension member is δ, then the total energy U stored is equal to the
work W done during loading.
U = W = Pδ/2

The strain energy per unit volume is
u = U/AL = σ2/2E

Properties for Two-Phase (vapor-liquid) Systems
Quality x (for liquid-vapor systems at saturation) is defined as the mass fraction of the vapor phase:
x = mg /(mg + mf)
where
mg = mass of vapor
mf = mass of liquid
Specific volume of a two-phase system can be written:
where

v

= xvg + (1 – x)vf or v = vf + xvfg

vf = specific volume of saturated liquid
vg = specific volume of saturated vapor
vfg = specific volume change upon vaporization

For ideal gases, cp – cv = R
Ideal gas behavior is characterized by:
• no intermolecular interactions
• molecules occupy zero volume
The properties of an ideal gas reflect those of a single molecule and are attributable entirely to the structure of the molecule and
the system T.

Real Gas
Most gases exhibit ideal gas behavior when the system pressure is less than 3 atm since the distance between molecules is large
enough to produce negligible molecular interactions. The behavior of a real gas deviates from that of an ideal gas at higher
pressures due to molecular interactions.
For a real gas, Pv = ZRT

Z = compressibility factor
Z = 1 for an ideal gas
Z ≠ 1 for a real gas

Thermodynamics

First Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of conservation of energy in a thermodynamic system. The net energy crossing
the system boundary is equal to the change in energy inside the system.
Heat Q (q = Q/m) is energy transferred due to temperature difference and is considered positive if it is inward or added to the
system.
Work W (w­= W/m) is considered positive if it is outward or work done by the system.

Closed Thermodynamic System
No mass crosses system boundary
Q – W = ∆U + ∆KE + ∆PE
where

∆U = change in internal energy
∆KE = change in kinetic energy
∆PE = change in potential energy

Energy can cross the boundary only in the form of heat or work. Work can be boundary work, wb, or other work forms
(electrical work, etc.)
Reversible boundary work is given by wb = ∫P dv.
Special Cases of Closed Systems (with no change in kinetic or potential energy)
Constant System Pressure process (Charles' Law):
wb = P∆v
(ideal gas) T/v = constant
Constant Volume process:
wb = 0
(ideal gas) T/P = constant
Isentropic process (ideal gas):
Pvk = constant
w = (P2v2 – P1v1)/(1 – k)
= R(T2 – T1)/(1 – k)
Constant Temperature process (Boyle's Law): (ideal gas) Pv = constant
wb = RTln (v2 / v1) = RTln (P1/P2)
Polytropic process (ideal gas):
Pvn = constant
w = (P2v2 – P1v1)/(1 – n), n ≠ 1

Open Thermodynamic System
Mass crosses the system boundary.
There is flow work (Pv) done by mass entering the system.
The reversible flow work is given by:
wrev = – ∫v dP + ∆KE + ∆PE
First Law applies whether or not processes are reversible.

The system does not change state with time. This assumption is valid for steady operation of turbines, pumps, compressors,

Basic Cycles
Heat engines take in heat QH at a high temperature TH, produce a net amount of work W, and reject heat QL at a low temperature
TL. The efficiency η of a heat engine is given by:
η = W/QH = (QH – QL)/QH
The most efficient engine possible is the Carnot Cycle. Its efficiency is given by:
ηc = (TH – TL)/TH
where TH and TL = absolute temperatures (Kelvin or Rankine).
The following heat-engine cycles are plotted on P-v and T-s diagrams in this section:
Carnot, Otto, Rankine
Refrigeration cycles are the reverse of heat-engine cycles. Heat is moved from low to high temperature requiring work, W.
Cycles can be used either for refrigeration or as heat pumps.
Coefficient of Performance (COP) is defined as:
COP = QH /W for heat pumps, and as
COP = QL/W for refrigerators and air conditioners.

149

Thermodynamics
Upper limit of COP is based on reversed Carnot Cycle:
COPc = TH /(TH – TL) for heat pumps and
COPc = TL /(TH – TL) for refrigeration.
1 ton refrigeration = 12,000 Btu/hr = 3,516 W
The following refrigeration cycles are plotted on T-s diagrams in this section: reversed rankine, two-stage refrigeration, air

Psychrometrics
Properties of an air-water vapor mixture at a fixed pressure are given in graphical form on a psychrometric chart as provided in
this section. When the system pressure is 1 atm, an ideal-gas mixture is assumed.
The definitions that follow use subscript a for dry air and v for water vapor.
P = pressure of the air-water mixture, normally 1 atm
T = dry-bulb temp (air/water mixture temperature)
Pa = partial pressure of dry air
Pv = partial pressure of water vapor
P = Pa + Pv
Specific Humidity (absolute humidity, humidity ratio) ω:
ω = mv /ma
where

mv = mass of water vapor
ma = mass of dry air
ω = 0.622Pv /Pa = 0.622Pv /(P – Pv)

Relative Humidity (rh) φ:
φ = Pv /Pg
where Pg = saturation pressure of water at T.
Enthalpy h:
h = ha + ωhv
Dew-Point Temperature Tdp:
Tdp = Tsat at Pg = Pv
Wet-bulb temperature Twb is the temperature indicated by a thermometer covered by a wick saturated with liquid water and in
contact with moving air.
Humid Volume: Volume of moist air/mass of dry air.

∆Sreservoir = Q/Treservoir
where Q is measured with respect to the reservoir.

Kelvin-Planck Statement of Second Law
No heat engine can operate in a cycle while transferring heat with a single heat reservoir.

For a multicomponent mixture at equilibrium
ftiV = ftiL
where

tf V = fugacity of component i in the vapor phase

tf L = fugacity of component i in the liquid phase

Fugacities of component i in a mixture are commonly calculated in the following ways:
For a liquid ftiL = xi γi f iL
where

where

γ1 = activity coefficient of component 1 in a two-component system
γ2 = activity coefficient of component 2 in a two-component system
A12, A21 = constants, typically fitted from experimental data

The pure component fugacity is calculated as:
where

f iL = Φisat Pisat exp %viL ` P − Pisat j ^ RT h/
Uisat = fugacity coefficient of pure saturated i

Limiting reactant – Reactant that would be consumed first if the reaction proceeded to completion. Other reactants are excess
reactants.
Selectivity – Moles of desired product formed/moles of undesired product formed.
Yield – Moles of desired product formed/moles that would have been formed if there were no side reactions and the limiting
reactant had reacted completely.

Chemical Reaction Equilibrium
For the reaction
aA + bB @ cC + dD
∆Gq =−RT ln Ka
Ka =

`atCc j`at Dd j

âi

= activity of component i =

`at aA j`at Bb j

= Π _ati i i
v

i

where
fti

f ci

fic
= fugacity of pure i in its standard state at the equilibrium reaction temperature T

vi

= stoichiometric coefficient of component i

∆G° = standard Gibbs energy change of reaction
Ka

= chemical equilibrium constant

For mixtures of ideal gases:
f ci = unit pressure, often 1 bar
tfi = y P = p
i

i

where pi = partial pressure of component i
Then Ka = Kp =

` pCc j ` pDdj
` p Aaj ` pBbj

= Pc + d - a - b

` yCc j ` yDdj
` y Aaj ` yBbj

For solids âi = 1
For liquids âi = xi γi
The effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant is
d ln K = DHc
dT
RT 2
where ∆H° = standard enthalpy change of reaction

Definition of Compressibility Factor
The compressibility factor z is the ratio of the volume actually occupied by a gas at given temperature and pressure to the volume the gas would occupy if it
behaved like an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. The compressibility factor is not a constant but varies with changes in gas composition,
temperature, and pressure. It must be determined experimentally.

Archimedes Principle and Buoyancy
1. The buoyant force exerted on a submerged or floating body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.
2. A floating body displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight; i.e., a floating body is in equilibrium.
The center of buoyancy is located at the centroid of the displaced fluid volume.
In the case of a body lying at the interface of two immiscible fluids, the buoyant force equals the sum of the weights of the fluids
displaced by the body.

Principles of One-Dimensional Fluid Flow
The Continuity Equation
So long as the flow Q is continuous, the continuity equation, as applied to one-dimensional flows, states that the flow passing
two points (1 and 2) in a stream is equal at each point, A1v1 = A2v2.
Q = Av
mo = ρQ = ρAv
where
Q = volumetric flow rate
mo = mass flow rate
A = cross-sectional area of flow
v = average flow velocity
ρ = fluid density
For steady, one-dimensional flow, mo is a constant. If, in addition, the density is constant, then Q is constant.

where hf = the head loss, considered a friction effect, and all remaining terms are defined above.
If the cross-sectional area and the elevation of the pipe are the same at both sections (1 and 2), then z1 = z2 and v1 = v2.
The pressure drop P1 – P2 is given by the following:
P1 – P2 = γ hf = ρghf

For unsteady flow due to local acceleration (i.e., temporal acceleration) in the x-direction, the change in pressure between two

Hydraulic Gradient (Grade Line)
Hydraulic grade line is the line connecting the sum of pressure and elevation heads at different points in conveyance systems.
If a row of piezometers were placed at intervals along the pipe, the grade line would join the water levels in the piezometer
water columns.

Energy Line (Bernoulli Equation)
The Bernoulli equation states that the sum of the pressure, velocity, and elevation heads is constant. The energy line is this sum
or the "total head line" above a horizontal datum. The difference between the hydraulic grade line and the energy line is the
v2/2g term.

The critical Reynolds number (Re)c is defined to be the minimum Reynolds number at which a flow will turn turbulent.
Flow through a pipe is generally characterized as laminar for Re < 2,100 and fully turbulent for Re > 10,000, and transitional
flow for 2,100 < Re < 10,000.

For flat plates placed parallel with the flow:
CD = 1.33/Re0.5 (104 < Re < 5 × 105)
CD = 0.031/Re1/7 (106 < Re < 109)
The characteristic length in the Reynolds Number (Re) is the length of the plate parallel with the flow. For blunt objects, the
characteristic length is the largest linear dimension (diameter of cylinder, sphere, disk, etc.) that is perpendicular to the flow.

Compressible flows are often accelerated or decelerated through a nozzle or diffuser. For subsonic flows, the velocity decreases
as the flow cross-sectional area increases and vice versa. For supersonic flows, the velocity increases as the flow cross-sectional
area increases and decreases as the flow cross-sectional area decreases. The point at which the Mach number is sonic is called
the throat and its area is represented by the variable, A*. The following area ratio holds for any Mach number.

Dimensional Homogeneity
Dimensional Analysis
A dimensionally homogeneous equation has the same dimensions on the left and right sides of the equation. Dimensional
analysis involves the development of equations that relate dimensionless groups of variables to describe physical phemona.
Buckingham Pi Theorem: The number of independent dimensionless groups that may be employed to describe a phenomenon
known to involve n variables is equal to the number (n – rr ), where rr is the number of basic dimensions
(e.g., M, L, T) needed to express the variables dimensionally.

Similitude
In order to use a model to simulate the conditions of the prototype, the model must be geometrically, kinematically, and
dynamically similar to the prototype system.
To obtain dynamic similarity between two flow pictures, all independent force ratios that can be written must be the same in
both the model and the prototype. Thus, dynamic similarity between two flow pictures (when all possible forces are acting) is
expressed in the five simultaneous equations below.

Boiling
Evaporation occurring at a solid-liquid interface when
Tsolid > Tsat, liquid
q" = h(Ts – Tsat) = hΔTe
where ΔTe = excess temperature
Pool Boiling – Liquid is quiescent; motion near solid surface is due to free convection and mixing induced by bubble growth
and detachment.
Forced Convection Boiling – Fluid motion is induced by external means in addition to free convection and bubble-induced mixing.
Sub-Cooled Boiling – Temperature of liquid is below saturation temperature; bubbles forming at surface may condense in
the liquid.
Saturated Boiling – Liquid temperature slightly exceeds the saturation temperature; bubbles forming at the surface are propelled
through liquid by buoyancy forces.

Typical boiling curve for water at one atmosphere: surface heat flux q"s as a function of excess temperature, ∆Te = Ts – Tsat
Free Convection Boiling – Insufficient vapor is in contact with the liquid phase to cause boiling at the saturation temperature.
Nucleate Boiling – Isolated bubbles form at nucleation sites and separate from surface; vapor escapes as jets or columns.
For nucleate boiling a widely used correlation was proposed in 1952 by Rohsenow:

Peak Heat Flux
The maximum (or critical) heat flux (CHF) in nucleate pool boiling:
qo max = Ccr h fg 8σgρ 2 v _ρ l − ρ v iB

1/4

Ccr is a constant whose value depends on the heater geometry, but generally is about 0.15.
The CHF is independent of the fluid-heating surface combination, as well as the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and specific
heat of the liquid.
212

Heat Transfer
The CHF increases with pressure up to about one-third of the critical pressure, and then starts to decrease and becomes zero at
the critical pressure.
The CHF is proportional to hfg, and large maximum heat fluxes can be obtained using fluids with a large enthalpy of
vaporization, such as water.

The relation above can be in error by 50% or more.
Transition Boiling – Rapid bubble formation results in vapor film on surface and oscillation between film and nucleate boiling.

Calibration – the comparison of an instrument's output to accepted input reference values (for example, using a different
instrument with known accuracy), including an evaluation of all the associated uncertainties. The formal definition of calibration
is published in ISO/JCGM 200:2012.
Transducer – a device used to convert a physical parameter such as temperature, pressure, flow, light intensity, etc. into an
electrical signal (also called a sensor).
Transducer Sensitivity – the ratio of change in electrical signal magnitude to the change in magnitude of the physical parameter
being measured.

Temperature Sensors
Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) – a device used to relate change in resistance to change in temperature. Typically made
from platinum, the controlling equation for an RTD is given by:
where

RT = R0 81 + a _T - T0 iB

RT = resistance of the RTD at temperature T (°C)
R0 = resistance of the RTD at the reference temperature T0 (usually 0°C)
α = resistance temperature coefficient of the RTD (typically 0.00385 Ω/Ω per °C for platinum)

thermistor might have A = 1.403 ×10–3; B = 2.373 ×10–4; C = 9.827 ×10–8.
Thermocouple (TC) – a device using the Seebeck effect to sense temperature differences. A thermocouple consists of two
dissimilar conductors in electrical contact a measured point and also at a reference junction; the voltage output is proportional to
the difference in temperature between the measured point and the reference junction.

Strain Transducers
Strain Gauge – a device whose electrical resistance varies in proportion to the amount of strain in the device.
Gauge Factor (GF) – the ratio of fractional change in electrical resistance to the fractional change in length (strain):
GF =
where

DR R DR R
= f
DL L

R = nominal resistance of the strain gauge at nominal length L
ΔR = change in resistance due the change in length ΔL
ε = normal strain sensed by the gauge

For metals, the change in resistance is due primarily to geometry. The gauge factor for metallic strain gauges is typically
around 2.
Piezoresistive effect – a change in the intrinsic electrical conductivity of a material due to a mechanical strain. For many
semiconductors, this leads to a gauge factor between 30 and 200 in strain transducers.
Piezoelectric effect – many crystalline or special ceramic materials convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. When a
mechanical force is applied, the material changes dimension and an electric field is produced. Piezoelectric transducers can
have many different geometries, including using multiple layers to increase gain. A simple peizoelectric transducer generates
electrical charge that is proportional to the change in its ceramic's volume or will change volume proportional to an applied
electric field. Dimensional changes are usually very small and can be predominantly in one dimension.

Sampling
When a continuous-time or analog signal is sampled using a discrete-time method, certain basic concepts should be considered.
The sampling rate or frequency is given by
fs = 1
Dt
Nyquist's (Shannon's) sampling theorem states that in order to accurately reconstruct the analog signal from the discrete
sample points, the sample rate must be larger than twice the highest frequency contained in the measured signal. Denoting this
frequency, which is called the Nyquist frequency, as fN, the sampling theorem requires that
fs > 2fN
When the above condition is not met, the higher frequencies in the measured signal will not be accurately represented and will
appear as lower frequencies in the sampled data. These are known as alias frequencies.

Analog-to-Digital Conversion
When converting an analog signal to digital form, the resolution of the conversion is an important factor. For a measured analog
signal over the nominal range [VL,VH], where VL is the low end of the voltage range and VH is the nominal high end of the
voltage range, the voltage resolution is given by
fV =

VH - VL
2n

where n is the number of conversion bits of the A/D converter with typical values of 4, 8, 10, 12, or 16. This number is a key
design parameter. After converting an analog signal, the A/D converter produces an integer number of n bits. Call this number
N. Note that the range of N is [0 , 2n – 1]. When calculating the discrete voltage, V, using the reading, N, from the A/D converter
the following equation is used.
V = fV N + VL
Note that with this strategy, the highest measurable voltage is one voltage resolution less than VH , or VH - fV .
225

Instrumentation, Measurement, and Control

Signal Conditioning
Signal conditioning of the measured analog signal is often required to prevent alias frequencies from being measured, and to
reduce measurement errors.

Measurement Uncertainty
Measurement Accuracy is defined as “closeness of agreement between a measured quantity value and a true quantity value of a
measurand." [cite ISO JCGM 200:2012, definition 2.13]
Measurement Precision is defined as “closeness of agreement between indications or measured quantity values obtained by
replicate measurements on the same or similar objects under specified conditions." [cite ISO JCGM 200:2012, definition 2.15]
It is critical to always consider the measurement uncertainty of your instrumentation and processes when performing
measurements. When reporting measurement results, it is necessary to provide an associated uncertainty so that those who use
it may assess its reliability. The Engineering Probability and Statistics section provides a high-level overview of measurement
uncertainty.
Suppose that a calculated result R depends on measurements whose values are x1 ± w1, x2 ± w2, x3 ± w3, etc., where
R = f(x1, x2, x3, ... xn), xi is the measured value, and wi is the uncertainty in that value. The uncertainty in R, wR, can be estimated
using the Kline-McClintock equation:

2. Frequency response evaluations to determine dynamic performance and stability. For example, relative stability can be
quantified in terms of
a. Gain margin (GM), which is the additional gain required to produce instability in the unity gain feedback control system.
If at ω = ω180,
∠G(jω180) = –180°; then

GM = –20log10 ` G _ j~180i j

b. Phase margin (PM), which is the additional phase required to produce instability. Thus,
PM = 180° + ∠G(jω0dB)
where ω0dB is the ω that satisfies G _ j~i = 1.

If the damping ratio ζ is less than unity, the system is said to be underdamped; if ζ is equal to unity, it is said to be critically
damped; and if ζ is greater than unity, the system is said to be overdamped.
For a unit step input to a normalized underdamped second-order control system, the time required to reach a peak value tp and
the value of that peak Mp are given by

The percent overshoot (% OS) of the response is given by

Breakeven Analysis
By altering the value of any one of the variables in a situation, holding all of the other values constant, it is possible to find a
value for that variable that makes the two alternatives equally economical. This value is the breakeven point.
Breakeven analysis is used to describe the percentage of capacity of operation for a manufacturing plant at which income will
just cover expenses.
The payback period is the period of time required for the profit or other benefits of an investment to equal the cost of the
investment.

Inflation
To account for inflation, the dollars are deflated by the general inflation rate per interest period f, and then they are shifted
over the time scale using the interest rate per interest period i. Use an inflation adjusted interest rate per interest period d for
computing present worth values P. The formula for d is d = i + f + (i × f)

Taxation
Income taxes are paid at a specific rate on taxable income. Taxable income is total income less depreciation and ordinary

Bonds

Bond value equals the present worth of the payments the purchaser (or holder of the bond) receives during the life of the bond at
some interest rate i.
Bond yield equals the computed interest rate of the bond value when compared with the bond cost.

Rate-of-Return
The minimum acceptable rate-of-return (MARR) is that interest rate that one is willing to accept, or the rate one desires to earn
on investments. The rate-of-return on an investment is the interest rate that makes the benefits and costs equal.

Chemical Reaction Engineering
Nomenclature
A chemical reaction may be expressed by the general equation
aA + bB ↔ cC + dD
The rate of reaction of any component is defined as the moles of that component formed per unit time per unit volume.
1 dN
- rA =- V dtA

_ negative because A disappears i

- rA =

if V is constant

- dCA
dt

The rate of reaction is frequently expressed by
where

–rA = kfr (CA, CB, ....)

k = reaction rate constant
CI = concentration of component I
In the conversion of A, the fractional conversion XA is defined as the moles of A reacted per mole of A fed.
XA = (CA0 – CA)/CA0

if V is constant

The Arrhenius equation gives the dependence of k on temperature
k = Ae E RT
− a

where

A = pre-exponential or frequency factor
Ea = activation energy (J/mol, cal/mol)
T = temperature (K)

R = gas law constant = 8.314 J/(mol•K)
For values of rate constant (ki) at two temperatures (Ti),
Ea =

Reaction Order

If - rA = kCAxCBy
the reaction is x order with respect to reactant A and y order with respect to reactant B. The overall order is

The density function describes the distribution of number of particles (fN) or volume of particles (fV) with respect to particle
size. At each particle size the cumulative density function provides the fraction of the total particles in terms of number of
particles (FN) and volume of particles (FV) that are smaller than that size. These density functions can be measured by a variety
of means. These functions may also be presented in discrete form where the range of particle sizes is divided into a number (m)
of sub-ranges, with each sub-range having a mean size as shown in the following figure:

*Plasticity index of A-7-5 subgroup is equal to or less than LL − 30. Plasticity index of A-7-6 subgroup is greater than LL − 30.
NP = Non-plastic (use "0"). Symbol "–" means that the particular sieve analysis is not considered for that classification.
If the soil classification is A4-A7, then calculate the group index (GI) as shown below and report with classification. The higher the GI, the less suitable the
soil. Example: A-6 with GI = 15 is less suitable than A-6 with GI = 10.

GI = ( F − 35 ) [ 0.2 + 0.005 ( L L − 40 ) ] + 0.01 ( F − 15 ) ( PI − 10 )

Structural Analysis
Influence Lines for Beams and Trusses
An influence line shows the variation of an effect (reaction, shear and moment in beams, bar force in a truss) caused by moving
a unit load across the structure. An influence line is used to determine the position of a moveable set of loads that causes the
maximum value of the effect.

The absolute maximum moment produced in a beam by a set of "n" moving loads occurs when the resultant "R" of the load
set and an adjacent load are equal distance from the centerline of the beam. In general, two possible load set positions must be
considered, one for each adjacent load.

Truss Deflection by Unit Load Method
The displacement of a truss joint caused by external effects (truss loads, member temperature change, member misfit) is found
by applying a unit load at the point that corresponds to the desired displacement.

Elementary Statically Indeterminate Structures by Force Method of Analysis
The force method is typically used to solve for elements or structures with a single degree of indeterminacy. The method states
that the deflection resulting from the removal of a redundant support is equal and opposite to the deflection that the redundant
reaction causes, resulting in a net zero deflection.

cThe global warming potential (GWP) for methane includes indirect effects of tropospheric ozone production and stratospheric water vapor

production.

dThe GWPs for ozone-depleting substances (including all CFCs, HCFCs, and halons, whose direct GWPs have been given in previous

reports) are a sum of a direct (positive) component and an indirect (negative) component which depends strongly upon the effectiveness of
each substance for ozone destruction. Generally, the halons are likely to have negative net GWPs, while those of the CFCs are likely to be
positive over both 20-and 100- year time horizons.

(KE). An idealized dc motor at steady state exhibits the following relationships:

Decibels is a technique to measure the ratio of two powers:
dB = 10log10 (P2/P1)
The definition can be modified to measure the ratio of two voltages:
dB = 20log10 (V2/V1)
Bode plots use a logarithmic scale for the frequency when plotting magnitude and phase response, where the magnitude is
plotted in dB using a straight-line (asymptotic) approximation.
The information below summarizes Bode plots for several terms commonly encountered when determining voltage gain,
Gv(jω). Since logarithms are used to convert gain to decibels, the decibel response when these various terms are multiplied
together can be added to determine the overall response.

Amplitude Modulation (AM)

xAM ^t h = Ac 7 A + m ^t hAcos _ 2rfct i

= Alc 71 + amn ^t hAcos _ 2rfct i

The modulation index is a, and the normalized message is
mn ^t h =

m ^t h
max m ^t h

The efficiency η is the percent of the total transmitted power that contains the message.
η=

where the mean-squared value or normalized average power in mn(t) is

+T
< mn2 ^t h > = lim 1 #- T mn ^t h dt
T " 3 2T

If M(f ) = 0 for |f | > W, then the bandwidth of xAM(t) is 2W.
AM signals can be demodulated with an envelope detector or a synchronous demodulator.

Double-Sideband Modulation (DSB)
xDSB(t) = Acm(t)cos(2πfct)
If M(f) = 0 for |f | > W, then the bandwidth of m(t) is W and the bandwidth of xDSB(t) is 2W. DSB signals must be demodulated
with a synchronous demodulator. A Costas loop is often used.

Upper Sideband:
xUSB ^t h * XUSB _ f i = XDSB _ f i =1 - P d

In either case, if M(f) = 0 for |f | > W, then the bandwidth of xLSB(t) or of xUSB(t) is W. SSB signals can be demodulated with a
synchronous demodulator or by carrier reinsertion and envelope detection.

Angle Modulation

xAng ^t h = Ac cos 72rfct + z ^t hA

The phase deviation φ(t) is a function of the message m(t).
The instantaneous phase is

φi ^ t h = 2πfct + φ ^ t h rad

The instantaneous frequency is

D~ ^ t h = dt z ^ t h rad/s
377

Electrical and Computer Engineering
The phase deviation is

φ ^ t h = kPm ^ t h rad

The complete bandwidth of an angle-modulated signal is infinite.
A discriminator or a phase-lock loop can demodulate angle-modulated signals.

Frequency Modulation (FM)
The phase deviation is

t
φ ^ t h = kF -#3 m ^λh dλ rad

The frequency-deviation ratio is
D=

kF max m ^t h
2πW

where W is the message bandwidth. If D << 1 (narrowband FM), the 98% power bandwidth B is
B ≅ 2W
If D > 1, (wideband FM) the 98% power bandwidth B is given by Carson's rule:
B ≅ 2(D + 1)W

Sampled Messages
A low-pass message m(t) can be exactly reconstructed from uniformly spaced samples taken at a sampling
frequency of fs = 1/Ts
fs > 2W where M(f ) = 0 for f > W
The frequency 2W is called the Nyquist frequency. Sampled messages are typically transmitted by some form of pulse
modulation. The minimum bandwidth B required for transmission of the pulse modulated message is inversely proportional to
the pulse length τ.
B ∝ 1x
Frequently, for approximate analysis
B , 1

is used as the minimum bandwidth of a pulse of length τ.

length, transmission of a pulse-code-modulated low-pass message m(t), with M(f) = 0 for f ≥ W, requires the transmission of at
least 2nW binary pulses per second. A binary word of length n bits can represent q quantization levels:
q = 2n
The minimum bandwidth required to transmit the PCM message will be
B ∝ 2nW = 2W log2 q

Error Coding
Error coding is a method of detecting and correcting errors that may have been introduced into a frame during data transmission.
A system that is capable of detecting errors may be able to detect single or multiple errors at the receiver based on the error
coding method. Below are a few examples of error detecting error coding methods.
Parity – For parity bit coding, a parity bit value is added to the transmitted frame to make the total number of ones odd (odd
parity) or even (even parity). Parity bit coding can detect single bit errors.
Cyclical Redundancy Code (CRC) – CRC can detect multiple errors. To generate the transmitted frame from the receiver, the
following equation is used:
where

T(x)/G(x) = E(x)

T(x) = frame
G(x) = generator
E(x) = remainder
The transmitted code is T(x) + E(x)
On the receiver side, if
[T(x) + E(x)]/G(x) = 0
then no errors were detected.
To detect and correct errors, redundant bits need to be added to the transmitted data. Some error detecting and correcting
algorithms include block code, Hamming code, and Reed Solomon.

Delays in Computer Networks
Transmission Delay – The time it takes to transmit the bits in the packet on the transmission link:
where

dtrans = L/R

L = packet size (bits/packet)
R = rate of transmission (bits/sec)
Propagation Delay – The time taken for a bit to travel from one end of the link to the other:
where

dprop = d/s
d = distance or length of the link
s = propagation speed

The propagation speed is usually somewhere between the speed of light c and 2/3 c.
Nodal Processing Delay – It takes time to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet to its
destination.
Queueing Delay – The packet may experience delay as it waits to be transmitted onto the link. Ignoring nodal and queueing
delays, the round-trip delay of delivering a packet from one node to another in the stop-and-wait system is
D = 2 dprop + dtransAck + dtransData
Because the sending host must wait until the ACK packet is received before sending another packet, this leads to a very poor
utilization, U, of resources for stop-and-wait links with relatively large propagation delays:
U = dtrans/D
For this reason, for paths with large propagation delays, most computer networking systems use a pipelining system called
go-back-N, in which N packets are transmitted in sequence before the transmitter receives an ACK for the first packet.

Automatic Request for Retransmission (ARQ)
Links in the network are most often twisted pair, optical fiber, coaxial cable, or wireless channels. These are all subject to
errors and are often unreliable. The ARQ system is designed to provide reliable communications over these unreliable links.
In ARQ, each packet contains an error detection process (at the link layer). If no errors are detected in the packet, the host (or
intermediate switch) transmits a positive acknowledgement (ACK) packet back to the transmitting element indicating that the
packet was received correctly. If any error is detected, the receiving host (or switch) automatically discards the packet and sends
a negative acknowledgement (NAK) packet back to the originating element (or stays silent, allowing the transmitter to timeout).
Upon receiving the NAK packet or by the trigger of a timeout, the transmitting host (or switch) retransmits the message packet
that was in error. A diagram of a simple stop-and-wait ARQ system with a positive acknowledgement is shown below.

DESTINATION

ACK

Transmission Algorithms
Sliding window protocol is used where delivery of data is required while maximizing channel capacity. In the sliding window
protocol, each outbound frame contains a sequence number. When the transmitted frame is received, the receiver is required to
transmit an ACK for each received frame before an additional frame can be transmitted. If the frame is not received, the receiver
will transmit a NAK message indicating the frame was not received after an appropriate time has expired. Sliding window
protocols automatically adjust the transmission speed to both the speed of the network and the rate at which the receiver sends
new acknowledgements.

where

D = / akr k + / air i
ak = the (k + 1) digit to the left of the radix point
ai = the ith digit to the right of the radix point

Binary Number System
In digital computers, the base-2, or binary, number system is normally used. Thus the decimal equivalent, D, of a binary number
is given by
D = ak 2k + ak – 12k – 1 + … + a0 + a–1 2–1 + …
Since this number system is so widely used in the design of digital systems, we use a shorthand notation for some powers of
two:
210 = 1,024 is abbreviated "K" or "kilo"
220 = 1,048,576 is abbreviated "M" or "mega"
Signed numbers of base-r are often represented by the radix complement operation. If M is an N-digit value of base-r, the radix
complement R(M) is defined by
R(M) = r N – M
The 2's complement of an N-bit binary integer can be written
2's Complement (M) = 2N – M
This operation is equivalent to taking the 1's complement (inverting each bit of M) and adding one.

Switching Function Terminology
Minterm, mi – A product term which contains an occurrence of every variable in the function.
Maxterm, Mi – A sum term which contains an occurrence of every variable in the function.
Implicant – A Boolean algebra term, either in sum or product form, which contains one or more minterms or maxterms of a
function.
Prime Implicant – An implicant which is not entirely contained in any other implicant.
Essential Prime Implicant – A prime implicant which contains a minterm or maxterm which is not contained in any other
prime implicant.
A function can be described as a sum of minterms using the notation
F(ABCD) = Σm(h, i, j,…)
= mh + mi + mj + …
A function can be described as a product of maxterms using the notation
G(ABCD) = ΠM(h, i, j,…)
= Mh  Mi  Mj  …
A function represented as a sum of minterms only is said to be in canonical sum of products (SOP) form. A function represented
as a product of maxterms only is said to be in canonical product of sums (POS) form. A function in canonical SOP form is often
represented as a minterm list, while a function in canonical POS form is often represented as a maxterm list.
393

Electrical and Computer Engineering
A Karnaugh Map (K-Map) is a graphical technique used to represent a truth table. Each square in the K-Map represents one
minterm, and the squares of the K-Map are arranged so that the adjacent squares differ by a change in exactly one variable.
A four-variable K-Map with its corresponding minterms is shown below. K-Maps are used to simplify switching functions by
visually identifying all essential prime implicants.

Computer Networking
Modern computer networks are primarily packet switching networks. This means that the messages in the system are broken
down, or segmented into packets, and the packets are transmitted separately into the network. The primary purpose of the
network is to exchange messages between endpoints of the network called hosts or nodes, typically computers, servers, or
handheld devices. At the host, the packets are reassembled into the message and delivered to a software application, e.g., a
browser, email, or video player.
Two widely used abstract models for modern computer networks are the open systems interconnect (OSI) model and the
TCP/IP model shown in the figure below.

the OSI model.
The application layer is the network layer closest to the end user, which means both the application layer and the user interact
directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating
component.
In the OSI model, the application layer interacts with the presentation layer. The presentation layer is responsible for the
delivery and formatting of information to the application layer for further processing or display. It relieves the application layer
of concern regarding syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems.
The OSI session layer provides the mechanism for opening, closing, and managing a session between end-user application
processes. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment,
termination, and restart procedures.
The transport layer adds a transport header normally containing TCP and UDP protocol information. The transport layer
provides logical process-to-process communication primitives. Optionally, it may provide other services, such as reliability,
in-order delivery, flow control, and congestion control.
394

Electrical and Computer Engineering
The network layer or Internet layer adds another header normally containing the IP protocol; the main role of the networking
layer is finding appropriate routes between end hosts, and forwarding the packets along these routes.
The link layer or data link layer contains protocols for transmissions between devices on the same link and usually handles error
detection and correction and medium-access control.
The physical layer specifies physical transmission parameters (e.g., modulation, coding, channels, data rates) and governs the
transmission of frames from one network element to another sharing a common link.
Hosts, routers, and link-layer switches showing the four-layer protocol stack with different sets of layers for hosts, a switch, and
a router are shown in the figure below.

ENCAPSULATION OF APPLICATION DATA THROUGH EACH LAYER

In computer networking, encapsulation is a method of designing modular communication protocols in which logically separate
functions in the network are abstracted from their underlying structures by inclusion or information hiding within higher-level
objects. For example, a network layer packet is encapsulated in a data link layer frame.

Protocol Definitions
•

TCP/IP is the basic communication protocol suite for communication over the Internet.

•

Internet Protocol (IP) provides end-to-end addressing and is used to encapsulate TCP or UDP datagrams. Both version 4
(IPv4) and version 6 (IPv6) are used and can coexist on the same network.

•

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol that detects lost packets, duplicated packets, or
packets that are received out of order and has mechanisms to correct these problems.

•

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless-oriented protocol that has less network overhead than TCP but provides
no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.

•

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol used to send error messages and operational
information.

Internet Protocol Addressing
This section from Hinden, R., and S. Deering, eds., RFC 1884--IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, 1995, as found on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1884 on October 16, 2019;
and Information Science Institute, University of Southern California, RFC 791--Internet Protocol, 1981, as found on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791 on Ocotober 16, 2019

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length and represented in dotted-decimal format using 4 decimal numbers separated by dots,
e.g., 192.268.1.1. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits and are represented by eight groups of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by
colons. Each group of digits is separated by a colon, e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. Optionally, leading
zeros in a group may be dropped in order to shorten the representation, e.g., 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334. One or more
consecutive groups containing zeros only may be replaced with a single empty group, using two consecutive colons (::), e.g.,
2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334. For both IPv4 and IPv6, the network address ranges can be specified in slash (/) - CIDR
(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation after the address. The integer following the slash indicates the number of leftmost
bits that are common to all addresses on the network. Alternately, for IPv4, the address range may also be specified by a
network mask, a 32-bit dotted decimal number with ones for all bits common to the address space, e.g., 192.168.5.0/24 can be
represented by 192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0.

Internet Protocol version 4 Header
The IPv4 packet header consists of 14 fields, of which 13 are required. The 14th field is optional and is named options. The
fields in the header are packed with the most significant byte first (big endian), and for the diagram and discussion, the most
significant bits are considered to come first (MSB 0 bit numbering). The most significant bit is numbered 0, so the version field
is actually found in the four most significant bits of the first byte, for example.

Options (if IHL > 5)

Version
The first header field in an IP packet is the four-bit version field. For IPv4, this is always equal to 4.

Internet Header Length (IHL)
The Internet Header Length (IHL) field has 4 bits, which is the number of 32-bit words. Since an IPv4 header may contain
a variable number of options, this field specifies the size of the header (this also coincides with the offset to the data). The
minimum value for this field is 5, which indicates a length of 5 × 32 bits = 160 bits = 20 bytes. As a 4-bit field, the maximum
value is 15 words (15 × 32 bits, or 480 bits = 60 bytes).

Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
Originally defined as the type of service (ToS), this field specifies differentiated services (DiffServ). New technologies are
emerging that require real-time data streaming and therefore make use of the DSCP field. An example is Voice over IP (VoIP),
which is used for interactive voice services.

Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
This field allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. ECN is an optional feature that
is only used when both endpoints support it and are willing to use it. It is effective only when supported by the underlying
network.

Total Length
This 16-bit field defines the entire packet size in bytes, including header and data. The minimum size is 20 bytes (header without
data) and the maximum is 65,535 bytes. All hosts are required to be able to reassemble datagrams of size up to 576 bytes, but
most modern hosts handle much larger packets. Sometimes links impose further restrictions on the packet size, in which case
datagrams must be fragmented. Fragmentation in IPv4 is handled in either the host or in routers.

Identification
This field is an identification field and is primarily used for uniquely identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram.

Flags
A three-bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments. They are (in order, from most significant to least
significant):
• bit 0: Reserved; must be zero
• bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF)
• bit 2: More Fragments (MF)
If the DF flag is set, and fragmentation is required to route the packet, then the packet is dropped. This can be used when
sending packets to a host that does not have resources to handle fragmentation. It can also be used for path MTU discovery,
either automatically by the host IP software, or manually using diagnostic tools such as ping or traceroute. For unfragmented
packets, the MF flag is cleared. For fragmented packets, all fragments except the last have the MF flag set. The last fragment has
a non-zero Fragment Offset field, differentiating it from an unfragmented packet.
399

Electrical and Computer Engineering
Fragment Offset
The fragment offset field is measured in units of eight-byte blocks. It is 13 bits long and specifies the offset of a particular
fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented IP datagram. The first fragment has an offset of zero. This
allows a maximum offset of (213 – 1) × 8 = 65,528 bytes, which would exceed the maximum IP packet length of 65,535 bytes
with the header length included (65,528 + 20 = 65,548 bytes).

Time To Live (TTL)
An eight-bit time to live field helps prevent datagrams from persisting (e.g., going in circles) on an internet. This field limits
a datagram's lifetime. It is specified in seconds, but time intervals less than 1 second are rounded up to 1. In practice, the
field has become a hop count—when the datagram arrives at a router, the router decrements the TTL field by one. When the
TTL field hits zero, the router discards the packet and typically sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the sender. The
program traceroute uses these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to print the routers used by packets to go from the source to the
destination.

Protocol
This field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram.

Header Checksum
The 16-bit IPv4 header checksum field is used for error-checking of the header. When a packet arrives at a router, the router
calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the checksum field. If the values do not match, the router discards the
packet. Errors in the data field must be handled by the encapsulated protocol. Both UDP and TCP have checksum fields. When a
packet arrives at a router, the router decreases the TTL field. Consequently, the router must calculate a new checksum.

Source Address
This field is the IPv4 address of the sender of the packet. Note that this address may be changed in transit by a network address
translation device.

Destination Address
This field is the IPv4 address of the receiver of the packet. As with the source address, this may be changed in transit by a
network address translation device.

Options
The options field is not often used. Note that the value in the IHL field must include enough extra 32-bit words to hold all the
options (plus any padding needed to ensure that the header contains an integer number of 32-bit words). The list of options
may be terminated with an EOL (End of Options List, 0x00) option; this is only necessary if the end of the options would not
otherwise coincide with the end of the header. The possible options that can be put in the header are as follows:

Version (4 bits)
The constant 6 (bit sequence 0110).

Traffic Class (6+2 bits)
The bits of this field hold two values. The six most-significant bits hold the Differentiated Services (DS) field, which is used to
classify packets. Currently, all standard DS fields end with a '0' bit. Any DS field that ends with two '1' bits is intended for local
or experimental use.
The remaining two bits are used for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN); priority values subdivide into ranges: traffic where
the source provides congestion control and non-congestion control traffic.

Flow Label (20 bits)
Originally created for giving real-time applications special service. When set to a non-zero value, it serves as a hint to routers
and switches with multiple outbound paths that these packets should stay on the same path, so that they will not be reordered. It
has further been suggested that the flow label be used to help detect spoofed packets.

Payload Length (16 bits)
The size of the payload in octets, including any extension headers. The length is set to zero when a Hop-by-Hop extension
header carries a Jumbo Payload option.

Next Header (8 bits)
Specifies the type of the next header. This field usually specifies the transport layer protocol used by a packet's payload. When
extension headers are present in the packet, this field indicates which extension header follows. The values are shared with those
used for the IPv4 protocol field, as both fields have the same function.

Hop Limit (8 bits)
Replaces the time to live field of IPv4. This value is decremented by one at each forwarding node and packet discarded if it
becomes 0. However destination node should process the packet normally even if hop limit becomes 0.

Source Address (128 bits)
The IPv6 address of the sending node.

Destination Port (16 bits)

Sequence Number (32 bits)
Has a dual role:
•

If the SYN flag is set (1), then this is the initial sequence number. The sequence number of the actual first data byte and the
acknowledged number in the corresponding ACK are then this sequence number plus 1.

•

If the SYN flag is clear (0), then this is the accumulated sequence number of the first data byte of this segment for the
current session.

Acknowledgment Number (32 bits)
If the ACK flag is set then the value of this field is the next sequence number that the sender of the ACK is expecting. This
acknowledges receipt of all prior bytes (if any). The first ACK sent by each end acknowledges the other end's initial sequence
number itself, but no data.

Data Offset (4 bits)
Specifies the size of the TCP header in 32-bit words. The minimum size header is 5 words and the maximum is 15 words thus
giving the minimum size of 20 bytes and maximum of 60 bytes, allowing for up to 40 bytes of options in the header. This field
gets its name from the fact that it is also the offset from the start of the TCP segment to the actual data.

402

Electrical and Computer Engineering
Reserved (3 bits)
For future use and should be set to zero.

Flags (9 bits) (aka Control bits)
Contains 9 1-bit flags
•

NS (1 bit): ECN-nonce - concealment protection (experimental).

•

CWR (1 bit): Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) flag is set by the sending host to indicate that it received a TCP segment
with the ECE flag set and had responded in congestion control mechanism.

•

ECE (1 bit): ECN-Echo has a dual role, depending on the value of the SYN flag. It indicates:
• If the SYN flag is set (1), that the TCP peer is ECN capable.
• If the SYN flag is clear (0), that a packet with Congestion Experienced flag set (ECN=11) in the IP header was
received during normal transmission. This serves as an indication of network congestion (or impending congestion) to the
TCP sender.

•

URG (1 bit): indicates that the Urgent pointer field is significant

•

ACK (1 bit): indicates that the Acknowledgment field is significant. All packets after the initial SYN packet sent by the
client should have this flag set.

•

PSH (1 bit): Push function. Asks to push the buffered data to the receiving application.

•

RST (1 bit): Reset the connection

•

SYN (1 bit): Synchronize sequence numbers. Only the first packet sent from each end should have this flag set. Some other
flags and fields change meaning based on this flag, and some are only valid when it is set, and others when it is clear.

•

FIN (1 bit): Last packet from sender.

Window Size (16 bits)
The size of the receive window, which specifies the number of window size units (by default, bytes) (beyond the segment
identified by the sequence number in the acknowledgment field) that the sender of this segment is currently willing to receive.

Checksum (16 bits)
The 16-bit checksum field is used for error-checking of the header, the Payload and a Pseudo-Header. The Pseudo-Header
consists of the Source IP Address, the Destination IP Address, the protocol number for the TCP-Protocol (0x0006) and the
length of the TCP-Headers including Payload (in Bytes).

Urgent Pointer (16 bits)
If the URG flag is set, then this 16-bit field is an offset from the sequence number indicating the last urgent data byte.

Options (Variable 0–320 bits, divisible by 32)
The length of this field is determined by the data offset field. Options have up to three fields: Option-Kind (1 byte), Option-Length
(1 byte), Option-Data (variable). The Option-Kind field indicates the type of option, and is the only field that is not optional.
Depending on what kind of option we are dealing with, the next two fields may be set: the Option-Length field indicates the total
length of the option, and the Option-Data field contains the value of the option, if applicable. For example, an Option-Kind byte of
0x01 indicates that this is a No-Op option used only for padding, and does not have an Option-Length or Option-Data byte following
it. An Option-Kind byte of 0 is the End Of Options option, and is also only one byte. An Option-Kind byte of 0x02 indicates that
this is the Maximum Segment Size option, and will be followed by a byte specifying the length of the MSS field (should be 0x04).
This length is the total length of the given options field, including Option-Kind and Option-Length bytes. So while the MSS value is
typically expressed in two bytes, the length of the field will be 4 bytes (+2 bytes of kind and length). In short, an MSS option field with
a value of 0x05B4 will show up as (0x02 0x04 0x05B4) in the TCP options section.
403

Electrical and Computer Engineering
Some options may only be sent when SYN is set; they are indicated below as. Option-Kind and standard lengths given as
(Option-Kind, Option-Length).
•

0 (8 bits): End of options list

•

1 (8 bits): No operation (NOP, Padding) This may be used to align option fields on 32-bit boundaries for better
performance.

•

2,4,SS (32 bits): Maximum segment size

•

3,3,S (24 bits): Window scale

•

4,2 (16 bits): Selective Acknowledgement permitted.

•

5,N,BBBB,EEEE,... (variable bits, N is either 10, 18, 26, or 34)- Selective ACKnowledgement (SACK) These first two
bytes are followed by a list of 1–4 blocks being selectively acknowledged, specified as 32-bit begin/end pointers.

•

8,10,TTTT,EEEE (80 bits)- Timestamp and echo of previous timestamp

•

The remaining options are historical, obsolete, experimental, not yet standardized, or unassigned. Option number
assignments are maintained by the IANA.

The UDP header consists of four fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits). The use of the checksum and source port fields is
optional in IPv4 (gray background in table). In IPv6 only the source port field is optional.

Source Port Number
This field identifies the sender's port, when used. If not used, it should be zero.

Destination Port Number
This field identifies the receiver's port and is required.

Length
This field that specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data. The minimum length is 8 bytes, the length of
the header. The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8 byte header + 65,527 bytes of data) for a UDP datagram.
However, the actual limit for the data length, which is imposed by the underlying IPv4 protocol, is 65,507 bytes (65,535 − 8
byte UDP header − 20 byte IP header).
Using IPv6 jumbograms, it is possible to have UDP packets of size greater than 65,535 bytes. RFC 2675 specifies that the
length field is set to zero if the length of the UDP header plus UDP data is greater than 65,535.

Electrical and Computer Engineering
Checksum
The checksum field may be used for error-checking of the header and data. This field is optional in IPv4 and mandatory in IPv6.
The field carries all-zeros if unused.

Internet Control Message Protocol
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supporting protocol in the Internet protocol suite and is used for Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information
indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. Internet Control
Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) is the implementation of ICMP for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

Local Area Network (LAN)
There are different methods for assigning IP addresses for devices entering a network.
•

Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) is a networking protocol that allows a router to assign the IP address and
other configuration information for all stations joining a network.

•

Static IP addressing implies each station joining a network is manually configured with its own IP address.

•

Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) allows for hosts to automatically configure themselves when connecting to an
IPv6 network.

Computer Systems
Memory/Storage Types
RAM – Primary memory system in computing systems, volatile
Cache – faster, but smaller segment of memory used for buffering immediate data from slower memories
•

L1: Level 1 cache, fastest memory available

•

L2: Level 2 cache, next level away from CPU. May or may not be exclusive of L1 depending on architecture
ROM – nonvolatile. Contains system instructions or constant data for the system
Replacement Policy – For set associative and fully associative caches, if there is a miss and the set or cache (respectively) is
full, then a block must be selected for replacement. The replacement policy determines which block is replaced. Common
replacement policies are:

•

Least recently used (LRU): Replace the least recently used block.

•

Most recently used (MRU): Replace the most recently used block.

•

First-in, first-out (FIFO): Also referred to as first come, first serve (FCFS) queue. Data is processed in the order it entered
the buffer.

•

Last-in, first-out (LIFO): Also referred to as a stack. Youngest (last) item is processed first.

•

Random: Choose a block at random for replacement.

•

Least frequently used (LFU): Replace the block that had the fewest references among the candidate blocks.
Write Policy – With caches, multiple copies of a memory block may exist in the system (e.g., a copy in the cache and a copy
in main memory). There are two possible write policies.

•

Write-through: Write to both the cache's copy and the main memory's copy.

•

Write-back: Write only to the cache's copy. This requires adding a "dirty bit" for each block in the cache. When a block in
the cache is written to, its dirty bit is set to indicate that the main memory's copy is stale. When a dirty block is evicted from
the cache (due to a replacement), the entire block must be written back to main memory. Clean blocks need not be written
back when they are evicted.
Cache Size – C (bytes) = S*A*B

where
S = Number of sets
A = Set associativity
B = Block size (bytes)
To search for the requested block in the cache, the CPU will generally divide the address into three fields: the tag, index, and
block offset.
TAG

•

INDEX

BLOCK OFFSET

Tag – These are the most significant bits of the address, which are checked against the current row (the row that has been
retrieved by index) to see if it is the one needed or another, irrelevant memory location that happened to have the same
index bits as the one wanted.
# tag bits = # address bits – # index bits – # block offset bits

•

Index – These bits specify which cache row (set) that the data has been put in.
# index bits = log2(# sets) = log2(S)

•

Block Offset – These are the lower bits of the address that select a byte within the block.
# block offset bits = log2(block size) = log2(B)

Multicore
A multicore processor is a single computing component with two or more independent actual processing units (called cores),
which are the units that read and execute program instructions. The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions such as Add,
Move Data, and Branch, but the multiple cores can run multiple instructions at the same time, increasing overall speed for
programs amenable to parallel computing.
A multicore processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical package. Designers may couple cores in a multicore
device tightly or loosely. For example, cores may or may not share caches, and they may implement message passing or
shared memory intercore communication methods. Common network topologies to interconnect cores include bus, ring,
two-dimensional mesh, and crossbar. Homogeneous multicore systems include only identical cores; heterogeneous multicore
systems have cores that are not identical. Just as with single-processor systems, cores in multicore systems may implement
architectures such as superscalar, VLIW, vector processing, SIMD, or multithreading.

Threading
In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed
independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes
differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within
the same process and share resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the
threads of a process share its instructions (executable code) and its context (the values of its variables at any given moment).
On a single processor, multithreading is generally implemented by time-division multiplexing (as in multitasking), and the CPU
switches between different software threads. This context switching generally happens frequently enough that the user perceives
the threads or tasks as running at the same time. On a multiprocessor or multicore system, threads can be executed in a true
concurrent manner, with every processor or core executing a separate thread simultaneously. To implement multiprocessing, the
operating system may use hardware threads that exist as a hardware-supported method for better utilization of a particular CPU.
These are different from the software threads that are a pure software construct with no CPU-level representation.

MSB – most significant bit first. Also known as Big-endian.

Pointers
A pointer is a reference to an object. The literal value of a pointer is the object's location in memory. Extracting the object
referenced by a pointer is defined as dereferencing.

Algorithms
An algorithm is a specific sequence of steps that describe a process.
Sorting Algorithm – an algorithm that transforms a random collection of elements into a sorted collection of elements.
Examples include:
Bubble Sort: continuously steps through a list, swapping items until they appear in the correct order.
Insertion Sort: takes elements from a list one by one and inserts them in their correct position into a new sorted list.
Merge Sort: divides the list into the smallest unit (e.g., 1 element), then compares each element with the adjacent list to
sort and merge the two adjacent lists. This process continues with larger lists until at last, two lists are merged into the
final sorted list.
Heap Sort: divides a list into sorted and an unsorted lists and extracts the largest element from the unsorted list and
moves it to the bottom of the sorted list.
Quick Sort: partitions list using a pivot value, placing elements smaller than the pivot before the pivot value and greater
elements after it. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted.
Searching Algorithm – an algorithm that determines if an element exists in a collection of elements. If the element does
exist, its location is also returned. Examples include:
Binary search: finds a search value within a sorted list by comparing the search value to the middle element of the array.
If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half,
again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.
Hashing: uses a hashing function that maps data of arbitrary size (e.g., a string of characters) to data of a fixed size
(e.g., an integer) and then to compute an index that suggests where the entry can be found in a hash table (an array of
buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found through the index).

412

Electrical and Computer Engineering

Data Structures
Collection – a grouping of elements that are stored and accessed using algorithms. Examples include:
Array: collection of elements, typically of the same type, where each individual element can be accessed using an
integer index.
Linked list: collection of nodes, where each node contains an element and a pointer to the next node in the linked list
(and sometimes back to the previous node).
Stack: collection of elements that are kept in order and can only be accessed at one end of the set (e.g., last in, first out
(LIFO))
Queue: collection of elements that are kept in order and can be accessed at both ends of the set where one is used to
insert elements and the other end is used to remove elements.
Map: collection of key, value pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. Also known as
an associative array.
Set: collection of elements, without any particular order, that can be queried (static sets) and/or modified by inserting or
deleting elements (dynamic set).
Graph: collection of nodes and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.
Tree: collection of nodes and a set of edges that connect the nodes hierarchically. One node is distinguished as a root
and every other node is connected by a directed edge from exactly one other node in a parent to child relationship. A
binary tree is a specialized case where each parent node can have no more than two children nodes.

Graph Traversal
There are primarily two algorithms used to parse through each node in a graph.
Breadth First Search – Beginning at a given node, the algorithm visits all connected nodes that have not been visited.
The algorithm repeats for each visited node. The output of the algorithm is a list of nodes in the order that they have
been visited. A queue data structure can be used to facilitate this algorithm.
Depth First Search – Beginning at a given node, the algorithm visits one connected node that has not been visited.
This is repeated until a node does not have any connected nodes that have not been visited. At this point the algorithm
backtracks to the last visited node and repeats the algorithm. The output of the algorithm is a list of nodes in the order
that they have been visited. A stack can be used to facilitate this algorithm.

Tree Traversal
There are three primary algorithms that are used to traverse a binary tree data structure.
In-Order Traversal
1. Traverse the left sub-tree.
2. Visit the root node.
3. Traverse the right sub-tree.
Preorder Traversal
1. Visit the root node.
2. Traverse the left sub-tree.
3. Traverse the right sub-tree.
Postorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left sub-tree.
2. Traverse the right sub-tree.
3. Visit the root node.

•

Text is a procedural variable, unless specified to be an object of type String

•

Variables can be constant, and are declared with the "const" modifier

•

Variables whose type is object and the exact specification of that object is not critical to the problem must have the
data type obj

•

Array indices are designated with square brackets [], not parentheses

•

Unless otherwise specified, arrays begin at 1 (one)

•

Compilation units are "procedure" and "function". "Module" is not a compilation unit

•

Function parameters are designated with parentheses ()

•

Unless specified, procedures and functions must have the return type "void"

•

Arguments in a function/procedure call are separated by semicolons

•

Class definitions start with "cls" (e.g., clsClassName)

•

Classes, properties, and procedures are by default public and may be optionally modified by "private" or "protected"

•

To instantiate an object, the follow syntax must be used: new clsName objName

•

For input, read ("filename.ext", <variable list>)—if reading from console, do not use the first argument

•

For output, write ("filename.ext", <expression list>)—if writing to console, do not use the first argument

•

The Boolean data type is "boolean"; the return result of all comparison operators is a boolean type
414

Electrical and Computer Engineering
•

The operator "*" in front of a variable is used to return the data at the address location within that variable

•

The operator "&" in front of a variable is used to return the address of a given variable. The declaration of "pointer_to" is
used to define a variable of a pointer type

Software Testing
There are many approaches to software testing but they are typically split into static testing versus dynamic and black box
versus white box testing.
Static Testing: techniques that do not execute the code but concentrate on checking the code, requirement documents
and design documents. Examples: code reviews and walkthroughs and compiler syntax and structure checks.
Dynamic Testing: techniques that take place when the code is executed and is performed in the runtime environment.
Examples: unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
Black Box Testing: examines functionality without knowledge of the internal code. Also known as functional testing,
the approach oftentimes concentrates on checking performance against specifications and also avoids programmer bias.
White Box Testing: verifies the internal structures and workings of a code. The approach is a necessary part of
software testing at the unit, integration and system levels, needed to uncover errors or problems, but does not detect
unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.

Linear Programming
The general linear programming (LP) problem is:
Maximize Z = c1x1 + c2x2 + … + cnxn
Subject to:
a11x1 + a12x2 + … + a1nxn ≤ b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + … + a2nxn ≤ b2
h
am1x1 + am2x2 + … + amnxn ≤ bm
x1, … , xn ≥ 0
An LP problem is frequently reformulated by inserting non-negative slack and surplus variables. Although these variables
usually have zero costs (depending on the application), they can have non-zero cost coefficients in the objective function. A
slack variable is used with a "less than" inequality and transforms it into an equality. For example, the inequality
5x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 ≤ 5 could be changed to 5x1 + 3x2 + 2x3 + s1 = 5 if s1 were chosen as a slack variable. The inequality
3x1 + x2 – 4x3 ≥ 10 might be transformed into 3x1 + x2 – 4x3 – s2 = 10 by the addition of the surplus variable s2. Computer
printouts of the results of processing an LP usually include values for all slack and surplus variables, the dual prices, and the
reduced costs for each variable.

Dual Linear Program
Associated with the above linear programming problem is another problem called the dual linear programming problem. If we
take the previous problem and call it the primal problem, then in matrix form the primal and dual problems are respectively:
Primal
Maximize Z = cx
Subject to: Ax ≤ b
x≥0

Dual
Minimize W = yb
Subject to: yA ≥ c
y≥0

It is assumed that if A is a matrix of size [m × n], then y is a [1 × m] vector, c is a [1 × n] vector, b is an [m × 1] vector,
and x is an [n × 1] vector.

Network Optimization
Assume we have a graph G(N, A) with a finite set of nodes N and a finite set of arcs A. Furthermore, let
N = {1, 2, … , n}
xij = flow from node i to node j
cij = cost per unit flow from i to j
uij = capacity of arc (i, j)
bi = net flow generated at node i
We wish to minimize the total cost of sending the available supply through the network to satisfy the given demand. The
minimal cost flow model is formulated as follows:
n

Minimize Z = ! ! cij xij
i= 1j= 1

/ xij - / xji = bi for each node i!N

and

0 ≤ xij ≤ uij for each arc (i, j)∈A

419

Industrial and Systems Engineering
The constraints on the nodes represent a conservation of flow relationship. The first summation represents total flow out of node
i, and the second summation represents total flow into node i. The net difference generated at node i is equal to bi.
Many models, such as shortest-path, maximal-flow, assignment and transportation models, can be reformulated as minimal-cost
network flow models.

Simulation
1. Random Variate Generation
The linear congruential method of generating pseudo-random numbers Ui between 0 and 1 is obtained using Zn = (aZn–1+C)
(mod m) where a, C, m, and Z0 are given nonnegative integers and where Ui = Zi /m. Two integers are equal (mod m) if their
remainders are the same when divided by m.

2. Inverse Transform Method
If X is a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function F(x), and Ui is a random number between 0 and 1,
then the value of Xi corresponding to Ui can be calculated by solving Ui = F(xi) for xi. The solution obtained is
xi = F–1(Ui), where F–1 is the inverse function of F(x).

Standard Time Determination
where

ST = NT × AF

NT = normal time
AF = allowance factor

Case 1: Allowances are based on the job time.
AFjob = 1 + Ajob
Ajob = allowance fraction (percentage/100) based on job time.
Case 2: Allowances are based on workday.
AFtime = 1/(1 – Aday)
Aday = allowance fraction (percentage/100) based on workday.
Predetermined time systems are useful in cases where either (1) the task does not yet exist or (2) changes to a task are being
designed and normal times have not yet been established for all elements of the new task or changed task. In such cases
no opportunity exists to measure the element time. Unfortunately, there is no scientific basis for predicting element times
without breaking them down into motion-level parts. A task consists of elements. An organization may develop its own
database of normal element durations, and normal times for new or changed tasks may be predicted if the tasks consist
entirely of elements whose normal times are already in the database. But new elements can be decomposed into motions,
for which scientifically predetermined times exist in databases called MTM-1, MTM-2, and MTM-3. These databases and
software to manipulate them are commercially available. To use one of them effectively requires about 50 hours of training.

where
N = number of teeth on pinion or gear
d = pitch circle diameter
φ = pressure angle
Gear Trains: Velocity ratio, mv, is the ratio of the output velocity to the input velocity. Thus, mv = ωout /ωin. For a
two-gear train, mv = –Nin /Nout where Nin is the number of teeth on the input gear and Nout is the number of teeth on the output
gear. The negative sign indicates that the output gear rotates in the opposite sense with respect to the input gear. In a compound
gear train, at least one shaft carries more than one gear (rotating at the same speed). The velocity ratio for a compound train is:
mv = !

product of number of teeth on driver gears
product of number of teeth on driven gears

A simple planetary gearset has a sun gear, an arm that rotates about the sun gear axis, one or more gears (planets) that rotate
about a point on the arm, and a ring (internal) gear that is concentric with the sun gear. The planet gear(s) mesh with the sun
gear on one side and with the ring gear on the other. A planetary gearset has two independent inputs and one output (or two
outputs and one input, as in a differential gearset).
Often one of the inputs is zero, which is achieved by grounding either the sun or the ring gear. The velocities in a planetary set
are related by
ωL − ωarm
=
ω f − ωarm ! mv
where

ωf = speed of the first gear in the train
ωL = speed of the last gear in the train
ωarm = speed of the arm

Neither the first nor the last gear can be one that has planetary motion. In determining mv, it is helpful to invert the mechanism
by grounding the arm and releasing any gears that are grounded.

Dynamics of Mechanisms
Gearing
Loading on Straight Spur Gears: The load, W, on straight spur gears is transmitted along a plane that, in edge view, is called
the line of action. This line makes an angle with a tangent line to the pitch circle that is called the pressure angle φ. Thus, the
contact force has two components: one in the tangential direction, Wt, and one in the radial direction, Wr. These components are
related to the pressure angle by
Wr = Wt tan(φ)

Definitions
Basic Size or nominal size, D or d, is the size to which the limits or deviations are applied. It is the same for both
components.
Deviation is the algebraic difference between the actual size and the corresponding basic size.
Upper Deviation, δu, is the algebraic difference between the maximum limit and the corresponding basic size.
Lower Deviation, δl, is the algebraic difference between the minimum limit and the corresponding basic size.
Fundamental Deviation, δF, is the upper or lower deviation, depending on which is closer to the basic size.
Tolerance, ∆D or ∆d, is the difference between the maximum and minimum size limits of a part.
International tolerance (IT) grade numbers designate groups of tolerances such that the tolerance for a particular IT number will
have the same relative accuracy for a basic size.
Hole basis represents a system of fits corresponding to a basic hole size. The fundamental deviation is H.

Some Preferred Fits
Clearance
Free running fit: not used where accuracy
is essential but good for large temperature
variations, high running speeds, or heavy
journal loads.

H9/d9

Sliding fit: where parts are not intended to
run freely but must move and turn freely and
locate accurately.

H7/g6

Locational clearance fit: provides snug fit
for location of stationary parts, but can be
freely assembled and disassembled.

H7/h6

Loose running fit: for wide commercial
H11/c11
tolerances or allowances on external members
Close running fit: for running on accurate
H8/f7
machines and for accurate location at
moderate speeds and journal pressures
Transition
Locational transition fit: for accurate location, H7/k6
a compromise between clearance and
interference
Locational transition fit: for more accurate
H7/n6
location where greater interface is permissible
Interference
Location interference fit: for parts requiring
rigidity and alignment with prime accuracy
of location but without special bore pressure
requirements.
Medium drive fit: for ordinary steel parts or
shrink fits on light sections. The tightest fit
usable on cast iron.

H7/p6

H7/s6

Force fit: suitable for parts which can be
H7/u6
highly stressed or for shrink fits where the
heavy pressing forces required are impractical.

Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T)
GD&T is used to communicate design intent. This reference provides materials drawn from the ASME Y14.5 standard:
"GD&T is an essential tool for communicating design intent—that parts from technical drawings have the desired form, fit,
function and interchangeability."
GD&T helps the designer provide information about the size, geometry, and location of features for mechanical parts.

Definitions used in ASME Y14.5
Regardless of Feature Size (RFS)
This is the default condition for geometric tolerances.

Least Material Condition (LMC)
This is a modifier for the geometric tolerance. The modifier defines the tolerance or acceptability where the part has the
least amount of material or weighs the least.

Maximum Material Condition (MMC)
This is a modifier for the geometric tolerance. The modifier defines the tolerance or acceptability where the part has the
most amount of material or weighs the most.

Feature Control Frame
From the ASME Y14.5 standard: "A feature control frame is a rectangle divided into compartments containing the
geometric characteristic symbol followed by the tolerance value or description, modifiers, and any applicable datum
reference features."

Datum
A datum is a plane, axis, point, or other reference geometry with respect to which the tolerance is specified.

Virtual Condition
The virtual condition is used to determine the clearance between mating parts. For an external feature, the virtual condition
is equal to the MMC plus the related geometric tolerance. For an internal feature, it is equal to the MMC minus the related
geometric tolerance.

in attitude (perpendicularity) of the axis of a
cylinder or slot in relationship to a datum(s).
 Where feature control frames contain the same
datums in the same order of precedence with the
same modifying symbols, they are considered a
single composite pattern. If not required, it must
state 'SEPARATE REQUIREMENT.'

 An axis to surface control.
 A composite control which includes roundness
and axis offset.
 Applies to each circular element independently.
 Datum applied on an RFS basis only.

 An axis to surface control.
 Provides composite control of all surface
elements. Used to control cumulative variations
of circularity, straightness, taper, and axis offset.
 Datum applied on an RFS basis only.

Intermediate- and Long-Length Columns
For both intermediate and long columns, the effective column length depends on the end conditions. The AISC recommended
design values for the effective lengths of columns are, for: rounded-rounded or pinned-pinned ends,
leff = l; fixed-free, leff = 2.1l; fixed-pinned, leff = 0.80l; fixed-fixed, leff = 0.65l. The effective column length should be used when
calculating the slenderness ratio.
The slenderness ratio of a column is Sr = l/r, where l is the length of the column and r is the radius of gyration. The radius of
gyration of a column cross-section is,
where I is the area moment of inertia and A is the cross-sectional area of the
column. A column is considered to be intermediate if its slenderness ratio is less than or equal to (Sr)D, where

E = Young's modulus of respective member
Sy = yield strength of the column material
For intermediate columns, the critical load is
2

where

1 SySr
Pcr = A >Sy − E d 2r n H
Pcr = critical buckling load
A = cross-sectional area of the column
Sy = yield strength of the column material
E = Young's modulus of respective member
Sr = slenderness ratio

For long columns, the critical load is
2

Pcr = r EA

where the variables are as defined above.

Static Loading Failure Theories
Brittle Materials
Maximum-Normal-Stress Theory
The maximum-normal-stress theory states that failure occurs when one of the three principal stresses equals the strength of the
material. If σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3, then the theory predicts that failure occurs whenever σ1 ≥ Sut or σ3 ≤ – Suc where Sut and Suc are the
tensile and compressive strengths, respectively.
Coulomb-Mohr Theory
The Coulomb-Mohr theory is based upon the results of tensile and compression tests. On the σ, τ coordinate system, one circle
is plotted for Sut and one for Suc. As shown in the figure, lines are then drawn tangent to these circles. The Coulomb-Mohr theory
then states that fracture will occur for any stress situation that produces a circle that is either tangent to or crosses the envelope
defined by the lines tangent to the Sut and Suc circles.

Ductile Materials
Maximum-Shear-Stress Theory
The maximum-shear-stress theory states that yielding begins when the maximum shear stress equals the maximum shear stress
in a tension-test specimen of the same material when that specimen begins to yield. If σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σ3, then the theory predicts that
yielding will occur whenever τmax ≥ Sy /2 where Sy is the yield strength.
σ −σ
τmax = 1 2 3 .
Distortion-Energy Theory
The distortion-energy theory states that yielding begins whenever the distortion energy in a unit volume equals the distortion
energy in the same volume when uniaxially stressed to the yield strength. The theory predicts that yielding will occur whenever

The term on the left side of the inequality is known as the effective or von Mises stress. For a biaxial stress state the effective
stress becomes

or

σl = aσ 2x − σ x σ y + σ 2y + 3τ 2xy k

where σA and σB are the two nonzero principal stresses and σx, σy, and τxy are the stresses in orthogonal directions.

Four-Bar Linkage

The four-bar linkage shown above consists of a reference (usually grounded) link (1), a crank (input) link (2), a coupler link
(3), and an output link (4). Links 2 and 4 rotate about the fixed pivots O2 and O4, respectively. Link 3 is joined to link 2 at the
moving pivot A and to link 4 at the moving pivot B. The lengths of links 2, 3, 4, and 1 are a, b, c, and d, respectively.
Taking link 1 (ground) as the reference (X-axis), the angles that links 2, 3, and 4 make with the axis are θ2, θ3, and θ4,
respectively. It is possible to assemble a four-bar in two different configurations for a given position of the input link (2). These
are known as the "open" and "crossed" positions or circuits.
