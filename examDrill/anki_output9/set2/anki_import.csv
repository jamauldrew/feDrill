Therefore, statement A is incorrect.<br><br>§1.4$e\$ states that the drawings should specify a part without specifying manufacturing methods. In other words, the means and methods of manufacturing should be left to the manufacturer.

However, §1.4$i\$ states that a “90° angle applies where center and lines depicting features are shown in 2D orthographic drawing at right angle and no angle is specified.” §1.4$j\$ further illustrates it.
