Three definitions given in the *NCEES Handbook* are relevant: least material condition $($LMC$)$, maximum material condition $($MMC$)$, and virtual condition. Based on the dimensioning and tolerancing specified in the problem, the hole diameter can vary from 0.990 to 1.010.<br><br>Since the cylinder has a tolerance of ±0.010, the cylinder’s limiting dimensions are<br>&lt;img src=&quot;000487.png&quot;&gt;  <br>According to ASME Y14.5 standard § 1.4 $($a$)$, “each dimension shall have a tolerance except for those dimensions specifically identified as reference, maximum, minimum, or stock.” Therefore, add tolerance to the nominal dimension. The nominal size of the cylinder is 0.97 ± 0.010.<br><br>***The answer is 0.97 ± 0.010.***<br><br><br><br># Local Variables:<br># org-drill-scope:    directory<br># org-drill-spaced-repetition-algorithm: sm2-anki<br># End:<br>","ME_Exam,Problem_109"
