The equation is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant real coefficients. For the form *y* ′ \+ *ay* = 0, the general solution is *y* = *Ce*−*at*. Here, *a* = 3, so *y* = *Ce*−3*t*.

The constant *C* must satisfy the boundary condition. Substitute *y*\(0\) = 1 into the general solution.

Which three of the following statements best define the Code of Ethics for Engineers? \(Select the three that apply.\)

\(A\)

a set of guidelines that describes how a licensed engineer should behave professionally

\(B\)

\(C\)

a set of rules that describes a licensed engineer’s responsibilities to the public, clients, and other licensees

\(D\)

a set of laws that describes how a licensed engineer must behave professionally

\(E\)

a set of rules that incorporates criminal penalties

**** 

Ethics are a set of guidelines, rules, philosophical concepts, customs, norms, and aspirations for a licensee to follow. The Code of Ethics for Engineers articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct.

In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for.

However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law ... Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.” For this reason, a violation of ethics does not trigger a criminal penalty unless such act is deemed a crime under a criminal statute. Statements D and E are incorrect.

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice section. A *copyright* covers original works of authorship, such as a book, song, or movie. Therefore, statement A is correct.

A *trademark* protects words, phrases, symbols, or designs made to identify a distinguishable source of a good or service. Therefore, statement B is correct. A *patent* protects unique inventions and discoveries. Therefore, statement C is correct.

A trade secret applies to a formula, pattern, device, method, technique, process, and so on. To meet the most common definition of a trade secret, it must be used in business and give an opportunity to obtain an economic advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Trade secrets offer little protection without a written agreement between the involved parties to keep it secret from others. In this case, the inventor intends to use it in business, but has not started using it. Therefore, the secret idea is not recognized as an intellectual property.

Generally, the code provisions provide the minimum design requirements a design professional must adhere to. Sometimes the minimum requirements are adequate, and sometimes they are not. In other occasions, the code provisions may not address a situation at all. In such situations, local engineering associations or specialty institutes provide the state-of-the-art information for the design issue. For example, an engineer uses the code yet designs a building system that performs poorly in an earthquake. Should the engineer use the same code provision again for the redesign? If not, what design criteria should be used in such a situation? A reasonable approach would be to look beyond the code provisions and incorporate state-of-the-art methods in design.

The engineer is not responsible for job site safety unless the engineer assumes such responsibility by contract or conduct. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The problem presents two mutually exclusive alternatives, out of which one alternative must be selected. There is no “do nothing” choice. The income and expenses for each option are converted to the equivalent present values, also called the *P*-pattern. The given annual interest rate is 8%. The *P*-value is the present net equivalent value of the stream of all future incomes and expenses. The alternative with the lowest *P*-value is selected.

The *P*-pattern values of a single future payment \(*P* given *F*\) and the stream of future payments \(*P* given *A*\) are tabulated in the *NCEES Handbook*, in the Engineering Economics section. Select the interest rate table for *i* = 8%.

**step 1: **

For equipment 1, its useful life is 10 years. Therefore, read two factor values for *n* = 10 in the table. The factor value *P*/*F* is used to convert the future salvage value to the present income value. The factor value *P*/*A* is used to convert the annual maintenance values to a single present expense.

Calculate the present worth, *P*1, for the first equipment option.

**step 2: 

The present worth, *P*2, for the second equipment option is
[[./images/000471.png]]

**step 1: **

Draw a sketch of the disk with the hole, as shown with the *x*- and *y*-axes. To locate the CG of an area, its *x*- and *y*-coordinates are needed. Due to symmetry about *x*-axis, the *y*-coordinate of the CG is zero, and thus the CG lies on the *x*-axis.

**step 2: 

It is known that the CG of a circle lies at its center. Therefore, the CG of a 12 in radius solid disk lies at point A, and the CG of a 6 in radius void lies at point B.

**step 3:

The belt friction formula is given in the *NCEES Handbook*, Statics: Belt Friction section.

The force *F*1 in the formula represents the tensile force on the pulling side. It is always larger than *F**  Therefore, statement A is correct, and statement B is incorrect.

The formula applies to friction problems where the angle of contact may exceed 360° \(2*π* rad\). If the rope is wrapped *n* times around a post, then angle *θ* becomes 2*πn.* Statement C is true.

The formula applies to friction problems involving band brakes. In band brakes, the band remains fixed, and the drum has impending rotation. Statement D is false.

The formula is applicable to problems involving ropes wrapped around a capstan or post. In this case, the capstan remains fixed, and the angle *θ* may exceed 2*π* rad. Statement E is false.

\(A\)

External forces

The external forces consist of the vertical reactions at beam supports. From statics, the UDL and the concentrated load, *P*, are equal in magnitude, and their centers of gravity coincide. As such, both loadings have their CGs at the midspan of the beam. Therefore, the beam reactions are equal for both loadings. Option A is correct.

The shear force and bending moments in the beam across the span are the internal forces. The internal forces are unique to the type of loading. See the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanics of Materials: Simply Supported Beam Slopes and Deflections. This table shows that the maximum bending moment induced by a concentrated load *P* is twice the bending moment induced by the same total load distributed over the beam span. Similarly, the deflection profiles under the loading differ substantially. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.

For the shear force and bending moment sign convention, use the convention given in the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanics of Materials: Beams.

The beam loading is symmetrical and, therefore, the reactions at supports A and C are equal. The shear force at any section is defined as the sum of the reaction and applied forces on the left of the section. To determine the shear force at any point along the beam span, consider the left support A as a reference point, and select the section at any distance between A and B.

1.  
The shear force at the left support A equals the support reaction.

2.  
The shear force at the section between A and B is the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads. As the applied uniformly distributed load is in the direction opposite to the reaction, the shear force at all sections between A and B would decrease linearly. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect.

3.  
The concentrated load at point B acts downward. The shear force is defined as the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads, so the shear force at midspan has a sharp drop, as shown in the option D.

4.  
By symmetry, the shear force diagram for the right side of the span, CB, is the mirror image of the shear force in the left side of the span, AB, except for the sign.

As given in the *NCEES Handbook*, the shear force is considered positive if the right portion of the beam tends to shear downward with respect to the left. In this case, the right portion of the beam tends to shear downward with respect to the left. Therefore, the shear force diagram option D has the proper sign convention.

***The answer is \(D\).***

Which of the following statements regarding the uniaxial stress-strain relationship of metals is NOT correct?

\(A\)

The slope of the linear portion of the curve equals the modulus of elasticity.

For nonlinear materials, the stress at 0.2 percent strain offset is called the yield strength.

\(C\)

The engineering stress is defined as the load divided by the initial cross-sectional area.

The true stress is defined as the average of the yield stress and the ultimate stress.

**** 

In elastic range, the stress is proportional to the strain. The stress-strain relationship is linear, and its slope is called the modulus of elasticity. Therefore, option A is true. In cases in which there is no well-defined yielding point, the yield strength is defined at the 0.2% strain offset. To determine the yield strength, draw a line at 0.2% strain, running parallel to the initial stress-strain curve. The intersection of the line and the stress-strain curve is defined as the yield stress of the material, as shown.

The isentropic process is a special case of an adiabatic process in which there is no transfer of heat or matter. See the *NCEES Handbook*, Isentropic Flow Relationships section. Air is compressible, and the figure shows a convergent-divergent nozzle. The problem describes a supersonic flow so that the velocity increases as the flow cross-sectional area increases.

To determine the area at exit point, determine the ratio of the exit area to the throat area \(*A*\*\) using the equation.

volume

pressure

\(C\)

**** 

A single component system in thermodynamics has two types of properties: intensive and extensive. The intensive properties are independent of mass; and the extensive properties are proportional to the mass of the system.

For example, the pressure and temperature are independent of the mass. Therefore, they are considered as the intensive properties.

The ratio of any extensive property of the system to the mass of the system is called the specific property. For example, specific volume is defined as volume per unit mass. While volume depends on the mass of the system, the specific volume is independent of the mass. Therefore, it is an intensive property of the system. Thus, options B, C, and D are intensive properties.

\(B\)

Fourier’s law states
[[./images/000370.png]] 
The term *x* in the equation stands for the distance between two bodies.

\(C\)

Convection is a process of heat transfer from a hot body to cold body, in a straight line, without affecting the intervening medium.

\(D\)

Thermal conductivity of solid metals decreases with an increase in temperature.

**** **

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Heat Transfer section. Newton’s law of cooling states that the heat transferred from a hot body to a cold body is directly proportional to \(1\) the surface area of the heat flow and \(2\) the difference of temperatures between the two bodies. The formula for the Newton’s cooling law is
[[./images/000616.png]] 
Therefore, statement A is incorrect.

Fourier’s law concerns the heat conduction. In conduction, heat transfers from one particle of the body to the other. The term *x* refers to the thickness of the body through which heat flows. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

Radiation is a process of heat transfer from a hot body to cold body, in a straight line, without affecting the intervening medium. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.

Thermal conductivity of solid metals decreases with increase in temperature; and thermal resistivity of solid metals increases with increase in temperature. Therefore, statement D is correct.

\(C\)

Transducer sensitivity is defined as the ratio of change in electrical signal magnitude to the change in magnitude of the physical parameter being measured.

\(D\)

A Wheatstone bridge is said to be balanced only if all four of its resistances are equal.

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Instrumentation, Measurement, and Control, and Fluid Mechanics sections. As stated in the Fluid Mechanics section, absolute pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure minus the vacuum gauge pressure reading.

The vacuum gauge pressure is the difference between the local atmospheric pressure and the absolute pressure. Therefore, option A is a correct statement.

As stated in the *NCEES Handbook*, the pressure sensors are called pressure transducers, pressure transmitters, pressure senders, pressure indicators, piezometers, and manometers. The sensors are typically based on measuring the strain on a thin membrane due to an applied pressure. Based on their design, pressure sensors are used to measure the absolute, gauge, or differential pressure. Therefore, option B is a correct statement.

As stated in the *NCEES Handbook*, the transducer sensitivity is defined as the ratio of change in electrical signal magnitude to the change in magnitude of the physical parameter being measured. Therefore, option C is a correct statement.

The Wheatstone bridge configuration is shown in the *NCEES Handbook*, Instrumentation, Measurement, and Control section. For the bridge to be balanced, all four of its resistances need not be equal. It is sufficient that

The coefficient of friction between a belt and its pulley is 0.24, and their angle of contact is 180°. The tension in the drive side of the belt is 200 lbf. What, most nearly, is the tension in the belt side resisting the impending motion?

\(A\)

48 lbf

\(B\)

94 lbf

\(C\)

110 lbf

\(D\)

200 lbf

**** **

The force on the drive side of the belt is given as 200 lbf. The other side of the belt is also called the slack side. See the *NCEES Handbook*, Belt Friction section.

**step 1: **

Apply the belt force transmission formula.
[[./images/000319.png]]  
*F*1 is 200 lbf force being applied in the direction of impending motion \(drive side or tight side\), and *F*2 is the force applied to resist impending motion \(slack side\).

The coefficient of friction and the contact angle between belt and pulley \(in radians\) are given as

Two 1/2 in thick plates are joined by oversized rivets as shown. The rivets are designed to transfer a tensile load that either plate can carry.
[[./images/000479.png]]  
The assembly’s most likely failure mode is by

\(A\)

pure shear

\(B\)

rupture

\(C\)

crushing of rivets

\(D\)

block shear

**** **

Three modes of failure of a riveted joint are shown in the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanical Engineering: Joining Methods section.

In this case, it is given that the joint rivets are oversized. Therefore, the rivets will not fail first; option A is incorrect. Both plates have equal thickness. Plate B is wider than plate A. Therefore, plate A is weaker and will fail before plate B does. Options C and D do not apply. Therefore, plate A will rupture or tear off, and the assembly will fail. Option B is correct.

***The answer is \(B\).***

A solid shaft has a nominal diameter of 20 mm. Its lower and upper deviations are 0.04 mm and 0.03 mm. For clearance fit, what is the maximum basic diameter of the shaft?

The terms basic size and nominal size are used interchangeably. In any production process, no component can be manufactured precisely to a given dimension; it can only be made to lie between two limits, upper and lower. Both deviations are defined in the *NCEES Handbook*. In this case, the deviations for the shaft are given. According to the metric standard, lowercase letters are used when referring to the shaft. Therefore,
[[./images/000667.png]] 
The *NCEES Handbook* defines fundamental deviation, *δ**F*, as the upper or lower deviation depending on which is closer to the basic size. In other words, it is the ***minimum difference in size between a component and the basic size***. This is identical to the upper deviation for shafts and the lower deviation for holes. Therefore,
