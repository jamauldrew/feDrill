The Code of Ethics for Engineers articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct.

In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for.

However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law ... Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.” For this reason, a violation of ethics does not trigger a criminal penalty unless such act is deemed a crime under a criminal statute.

","For the shear force and bending moment sign convention, use the convention given in the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanics of Materials: Beams.

The beam loading is symmetrical and, therefore, the reactions at supports A and C are equal. The shear force at any section is defined as the sum of the reaction and applied forces on the left of the section. To determine the shear force at any point along the beam span, consider the left support A as a reference point, and select the section at any distance between A and B.

1.  
The shear force at the left support A equals the support reaction.

2.  
The shear force at the section between A and B is the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads. As the applied uniformly distributed load is in the direction opposite to the reaction, the shear force at all sections between A and B would decrease linearly. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect.

3.  
The concentrated load at point B acts downward. The shear force is defined as the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads, so the shear force at midspan has a sharp drop, as shown in the option D.

By symmetry, the shear force diagram for the right side of the span, CB, is the mirror image of the shear force in the left side of the span, AB, except for the sign.

As given in the *NCEES Handbook*, the shear force is considered positive if the right portion of the beam tends to shear downward with respect to the left.
