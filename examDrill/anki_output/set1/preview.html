a set of rules that describes a licensed engineer’s responsibilities to the public, clients, and other licensees

[latex]E[/latex]

a set of rules that incorporates criminal penalties</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Ethics are a set of guidelines, rules, philosophical concepts, customs, norms, and aspirations for a licensee to follow. The Code of Ethics for Engineers articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct.

In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for.

However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law ... Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.” For this reason, a violation of ethics does not trigger a criminal penalty unless such act is deemed a crime under a criminal statute. Statements D and E are incorrect.

A trade secret applies to a formula, pattern, device, method, technique, process, and so on. To meet the most common definition of a trade secret, it must be used in business and give an opportunity to obtain an economic advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Trade secrets offer little protection without a written agreement between the involved parties to keep it secret from others. In this case, the inventor intends to use it in business, but has not started using it. Therefore, the secret idea is not recognized as an intellectual property.

The parameters such as air and water pollution and atmospheric emissions are required in a life-cycle analysis. The *NCEES Handbook* does not explicitly provide information on greenhouse gases. The subject is covered in many textbooks. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds. There is no standard global method available for calculating the carbon footprint.

The engineer should produce a set of perfect drawings.

[latex]B[/latex]

The engineer should meet the minimum requirement of the governing building code and no more.

[latex]D[/latex]

The engineer is responsible for the job site safety of workers.</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Option A is incorrect because a standard of perfection cannot be met.

Option B is incorrect because meeting the minimum code requirement may not result in meeting the standard of care. Generally, the code provisions provide the minimum design requirements a design professional must adhere to. Sometimes the minimum requirements are adequate, and sometimes they are not. In other occasions, the code provisions may not address a situation at all. In such situations, local engineering associations or specialty institutes provide the state-of-the-art information for the design issue. For example, an engineer uses the code yet designs a building system that performs poorly in an earthquake. Should the engineer use the same code provision again for the redesign? If not, what design criteria should be used in such a situation? A reasonable approach would be to look beyond the code provisions and incorporate state-of-the-art methods in design.

The engineer is not responsible for job site safety unless the engineer assumes such responsibility by contract or conduct. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Statics: Centroids of Masses, Areas, Lengths, and Volumes section, for the formula to compute the CG of an area. However, the solution does not require any calculations to determine the CG of the area.

**step 1: **

Draw a sketch of the disk with the hole, as shown with the <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-axes. To locate the CG of an area, its <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinates are needed. Due to symmetry about <em>x</em>-axis, the <em>y</em>-coordinate of the CG is zero, and thus the CG lies on the <em>x</em>-axis.
<img src="images/000053.png"> 

**step 2: 

It is known that the CG of a circle lies at its center. Therefore, the CG of a 12 in radius solid disk lies at point A, and the CG of a 6 in radius void lies at point B.

**step 3: 

After the 6 in radius circular is cut out, there is more area left of point A than on the right side of point A. Therefore, the CG of the composite area shifts to the left of point A, along the <em>x</em>-axis.

External forces

None of the above</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>The external forces consist of the vertical reactions at beam supports. From statics, the UDL and the concentrated load, <em>P</em>, are equal in magnitude, and their centers of gravity coincide. As such, both loadings have their CGs at the midspan of the beam. Therefore, the beam reactions are equal for both loadings. Option A is correct.

The shear force and bending moments in the beam across the span are the internal forces. The internal forces are unique to the type of loading. See the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanics of Materials: Simply Supported Beam Slopes and Deflections. This table shows that the maximum bending moment induced by a concentrated load <em>P</em> is twice the bending moment induced by the same total load distributed over the beam span. Similarly, the deflection profiles under the loading differ substantially. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.

<img src="images/000760.png"></div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>For the shear force and bending moment sign convention, use the convention given in the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanics of Materials: Beams.

The beam loading is symmetrical and, therefore, the reactions at supports A and C are equal. The shear force at any section is defined as the sum of the reaction and applied forces on the left of the section. To determine the shear force at any point along the beam span, consider the left support A as a reference point, and select the section at any distance between A and B.

1.  
The shear force at the left support A equals the support reaction.

2.  
The shear force at the section between A and B is the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads. As the applied uniformly distributed load is in the direction opposite to the reaction, the shear force at all sections between A and B would decrease linearly. Therefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect.

3.  
The concentrated load at point B acts downward. The shear force is defined as the sum of the support reaction at A and the applied loads, so the shear force at midspan has a sharp drop, as shown in the option D.

4.  
By symmetry, the shear force diagram for the right side of the span, CB, is the mirror image of the shear force in the left side of the span, AB, except for the sign.

A cylindrical vessel can be classified as a thin-walled or thick-walled vessel. If the thickness of the cylinder wall is about 1/10 or less of the inside radius, the cylinder is considered thin-walled. In this problem, it is given that the cylindrical vessel is thin-walled. A cylindrical pressure vessel under an internal pressure is subjected to two types of stresses: axial and radial [latex]or hoop[/latex] stresses. For a thin-walled cylinder under internal pressure, its hoop stress is double the axial stress. Therefore, in designing the wall thickness of a cylinder, tangential [latex]hoop[/latex] stress controls.
