The product matrix <em>C</em> will have three rows and two columns.

[latex]C[/latex]

The product matrix <em>C</em> will have three rows and three columns.

The multiplication is not possible since the matrices <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> do not have the same number of rows and columns.</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix should equal the number of rows in the second matrix. In this case, the condition is satisfied because matrix <em>A</em> has two columns and matrix <em>B</em> has two rows. Therefore, the multiplication of matrices <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is possible. Option D is incorrect. The product matrix will have as many rows as the first matrix and as many columns as the second matrix.

a set of rules that incorporate criminal penalties</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Ethics are a set of guidelines, rules, philosophical concepts, customs, norms, and aspirations for a licensee to follow. The Code articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct. In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for. However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law. . . Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.”

I, III, and IV</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>See the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: Intellectual Property section. One of the requirements to be protected under copyright laws is that the work must be tangible. Ideas are intangible and cannot be copyrighted. Therefore, statement I is incorrect.

To be protected under copyright laws, the work must be original, whether published or unpublished. Therefore, statement II is correct.

To be protected under copyright laws, the work must be original, whether published or unpublished. In this case, the engineer has her intellectual property right over the improvements she designed and implemented in the new machine. Her original work is not considered as copyright infringement. Therefore, statement III is correct.

As stated in the *NCEES Handbook*, a utility patent may be granted to anyone who discovers any new machine or article of manufacture. As such, she may be entitled to a utility patent to the extent of her discovery and invention. Statement IV is correct.

Select the type of insurance that the firm should procure.

[latex]A[/latex]

general liability insurance

[latex]B[/latex]

comprehensive insurance

[latex]C[/latex]

engineer’s hazard insurance

[latex]D[/latex]

negligence insurance</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>See the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct. Engineers are required to perform their professional services at a reasonable standard of care. If an engineer falls short of this standard, the engineer can be found negligent, lacking competence, and committing errors and omission.

An engineer’s liability of can be divided into two categories: professional liability and general liability. Accordingly, different insurance policies are needed to cover a claim arising out of acts and omission of the insured. As a buffer against the professional liability, an engineering firm can purchase insurance to protect itself and its employees. It is called errors and omissions [latex]E&O[/latex] insurance, professional liability [latex]PL[/latex] insurance, negligence insurance, or malpractice insurance. With the payment of the required premium, the E&O insurance protects the firm and its design professional employees from the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client or others. Option D is correct. The insurance types listed in options A through C cover general or nonprofessional situations. For example, a firm can procure auto insurance to cover liabilities resulting from the employees’ use of their vehicles to conduct activities within the scope of their employment.

According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct, A, it is the paramount duty of an engineer to safeguard the life, health, and welfare of the public in conducting their professional service. Therefore, B is a correct option.

According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct, B.2, licensees should meet two requirements before affixing their seal: [latex]1[/latex] plans or documents must be prepared under their responsible charge and [latex]2[/latex] must have competence in the area of design. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Unless required by the contract with their client, there is no ethical requirement for a licensee to specify only green or environmentally friendly materials in design. According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: Societal Considerations section, the engineers must consider sustainable principles, as a part of the societal considerations.

The force of friction between the two surfaces is independent of the speed at which the block slides on the surface.</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>See the *NCEES Handbook*, Statics: Friction section. Limiting friction is defined as the maximum frictional force, which comes into play when a body just begins to slide over the surface of another body. Thus, option A is correct.

The frictional force is a vector and is independent of the area of contact. Thus, statements B and C are incorrect, and statement D is correct.

As a body starts to slide, the force of friction remains constant at moderate speeds, but decreases slightly as the speed increases. Thus, statement E is incorrect.

[latex]B[/latex]

Hardenability and hardness are synonymous.

Hardness, and not hardenability, is a measure of resistance of plastic deformation as measured by indentation. Hardenability is the ability or potential of a steel to achieve a certain hardness at a given depth, upon suitable heat treatment and quench. The two terms are not synonymous. Therefore, the statements A and B are incorrect.

Hardenability is not for all metals or their alloys. Hardness can be measured in metals in any condition. Hardenability presumes that the steels will be heat-treated to achieve a targeted hardness at a given depth. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.

It is true that hardenability can be gauged by using the Jominy [latex]H-band[/latex] or curves. The hardenability varies with the steel chemistry and the quenching rates, as shown in the *NCEES Handbook* graph.

[latex]D[/latex]

In corrosion, surface of the object changes from one element into another element.</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>See the *NCEES Handbook*, Chemistry and Biology Oxidation Potentials for Corrosion Reactions table.

It is true that corrosion is a chemical reaction. In the corrosion process, there is a transfer of electrons from one chemical species to another. Therefore, option A is a correct statement.

It is true that there is no method of measuring the absolute value of an electrode potential. All electrode potentials are determined under a standard condition with reference to a standard hydrogen electrode whose value is considered as zero, as shown in the table. Therefore, option B is a correct statement.

The metals having electrode potential lower than that of hydrogen are known as anodic metals, and not as cathodic metals. Option C is a correct statement.

The surface of the object changes from an element to a compound and not to another element. For example, aluminum develops a thin oxidation layer immediately upon exposure to the atmosphere. The oxide film protects the surface from further oxidation. This is a change from an element to a compound. Therefore, option D is an incorrect statement.

The term “fatigue fracture” is defined as the fracture that is caused by repeatedly applied fatigue stresses. The fatigue strength is directly related to the ultimate strength of the metal. The fatigue fracture stresses are well below the tensile strength of the metal or alloy used. The higher the tensile strength, the higher the fatigue fracture stress, given the fatigue stress level.
