For a geothermal project, the temperature increases from 20°C at the surface of the earth to 90°C at a depth of 2 km below the ground. Assuming a linear temperature gradient, the underground temperature at 3800 m below the ground surface is most nearly

\(A\)

113°C

\(B\)

133°C

\(C\)

153°C

\(D\)

173°C

**** 

Geothermal energy is generated when water comes into contact with heated underground rocks. The heat turns the water into a steam which can be used to generate power. In this problem, the thermal gradient, *m*, is constant because the thermal variation along the depth is linear. Calculate the slope, *m*.

Matrices *A* and *B* are multiplied to obtain a product matrix *C*. Which statement about the matrix multiplication is true?

\(A\)

The product matrix *C* will have two rows and three columns.

\(B\)

The product matrix *C* will have three rows and two columns.

\(C\)

The product matrix *C* will have three rows and three columns.

\(D\)

The multiplication is not possible since the matrices *A* and *B* do not have the same number of rows and columns.

**** 

To multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix should equal the number of rows in the second matrix. In this case, the condition is satisfied because matrix *A* has two columns and matrix *B* has two rows. Therefore, the multiplication of matrices *A* and *B* is possible. Option D is incorrect. The product matrix will have as many rows as the first matrix and as many columns as the second matrix. Therefore, the product matrix *C* will have three rows and three columns.

Ethics are a set of guidelines, rules, philosophical concepts, customs, norms, and aspirations for a licensee to follow. The Code articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct. In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for. However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law. . . Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.”

To be protected under copyright laws, the work must be original, whether published or unpublished. In this case, the engineer has her intellectual property right over the improvements she designed and implemented in the new machine. Her original work is not considered as copyright infringement.

An engineering firm desires to reduce its risk arising out of its design work of its employees. Select the type of insurance that the firm should procure.

\(A\)

general liability insurance

\(B\)

comprehensive insurance

\(C\)

engineer’s hazard insurance

\(D\)

negligence insurance

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct. Engineers are required to perform their professional services at a reasonable standard of care. If an engineer falls short of this standard, the engineer can be found negligent, lacking competence, and committing errors and omission.

An engineer’s liability of can be divided into two categories: professional liability and general liability. Accordingly, different insurance policies are needed to cover a claim arising out of acts and omission of the insured. As a buffer against the professional liability, an engineering firm can purchase insurance to protect itself and its employees. It is called errors and omissions \(E&O\) insurance, professional liability \(PL\) insurance, negligence insurance, or malpractice insurance. With the payment of the required premium, the E&O insurance protects the firm and its design professional employees from the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client or others. Option D is correct. The insurance types listed in options A through C cover general or nonprofessional situations. For example, a firm can procure auto insurance to cover liabilities resulting from the employees’ use of their vehicles to conduct activities within the scope of their employment.

**** 

Meeting the minimum requirements of a building code may not yield sound design documents. The documents must conform to the accepted engineering standards in order to safeguard the life, health, property, and welfare of the public. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct, A, it is the paramount duty of an engineer to safeguard the life, health, and welfare of the public in conducting their professional service. Therefore, B is a correct option.

According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: *Model Rules*, Section 240.15 Rules of Professional Conduct, B.2, licensees should meet two requirements before affixing their seal: \(1\) plans or documents must be prepared under their responsible charge and \(2\) must have competence in the area of design. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Unless required by the contract with their client, there is no ethical requirement for a licensee to specify only green or environmentally friendly materials in design. According to the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: Societal Considerations section, the engineers must consider sustainable principles, as a part of the societal considerations. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The force of friction between the two surfaces is independent of the contact area.

\(E\)

The force of friction between the two surfaces is independent of the speed at which the block slides on the surface.

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Statics: Friction section. Limiting friction is defined as the maximum frictional force, which comes into play when a body just begins to slide over the surface of another body. Thus, option A is correct.

The frictional force is a vector and is independent of the area of contact. Thus, statements B and C are incorrect, and statement D is correct.

As a body starts to slide, the force of friction remains constant at moderate speeds, but decreases slightly as the speed increases. Thus, statement E is incorrect.

It carries a vertical load of 10 kN at joint E. Which members in the truss have zero force?

\(A\)

\(C\)

\(D\)

**** 

Use the truss analysis method given the *NCEES Handbook*. Alternately, use the zero-force member rule, which states that the force in a member is zero if

\(a\) two noncollinear members are connected to a joint that has no external loads or reactions applied to it; then, the force in both members is zero, or

\(b\) in a three-member joint, two members are collinear, and the joint has no external loads or reactions applied to it; then, the force in the noncollinear member is zero.

**step 1: **

Since the load is applied to point E, all members \(AB, BC, CD, DE, EF\) along the bottom chord have nonzero force.

**step 2: **

Since the reactions at supports A and F are nonzero, the forces in the member AJ and FJ are nonzero.

**step 3: **

Apply the zero-force rule to all other members. Thus, the six zero-force members are EK, DJ, CJ, CH, BH, and BG.

The principle of a Charpy machine is that the pendulum’s potential energy is lost in causing failure of the test specimen. Use the *NCEES Handbook*, Dynamics: Potential Energy section to determine the energy. The energy absorbed by the specimen in breaking, Δ*U*, is equal to the potential energy \(PE\) at the angle at which the pendulum was released \(point A\), minus the PE at the angle the pendulum reached after causing failure of the specimen \(point B\).

Two bars, A and B, of equal lengths are joined and act compositely. Bar A has higher modulus of thermal expansion than bar B. When the system temperature is raised, what type of stress will be induced in bar A?

\(A\)

compressive stress

tensile stress

As the temperature rises, bar A tends to expand more than bar B, as shown.

In an unrestrained situation, neither bar would have any induced stress. If they are restrained to expand or contract equally, stresses would be induced in both bars. Bar A is not able to fully expand due to restraint caused by bar B. As such, bar A is in compression, bar B is in tension, and both bars expand equally.

\(B\)

Hardenability and hardness are synonymous.

\(C\)

Hardenability can be measured in the state the metal is in.

\(D\)

Hardenability can be gauged by using the Jominy curves.

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Materials Science/Structure of Matter section. Hardness is resistance to penetration; hardenability is the “ease” with which hardness can be obtained.

Hardness, and not hardenability, is a measure of resistance of plastic deformation as measured by indentation. Hardenability is the ability or potential of a steel to achieve a certain hardness at a given depth, upon suitable heat treatment and quench. The two terms are not synonymous. Therefore, the statements A and B are incorrect.

Hardenability is not for all metals or their alloys. Hardness can be measured in metals in any condition. Hardenability presumes that the steels will be heat-treated to achieve a targeted hardness at a given depth. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.

It is true that hardenability can be gauged by using the Jominy \(H-band\) or curves. The hardenability varies with the steel chemistry and the quenching rates, as shown in the *NCEES Handbook* graph.

The cold working process reduces toughness, impact strength, and ductility. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. The cold working improves hardness. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

\(B\)

There is no method of measuring absolute value of an electrode potential.

\(C\)

The metals having electrode potential lower than that of hydrogen are known as anodic or active metals.

\(D\)

In corrosion, surface of the object changes from one element into another element.

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Chemistry and Biology Oxidation Potentials for Corrosion Reactions table.

It is true that corrosion is a chemical reaction. In the corrosion process, there is a transfer of electrons from one chemical species to another. Therefore, option A is a correct statement.

It is true that there is no method of measuring the absolute value of an electrode potential. All electrode potentials are determined under a standard condition with reference to a standard hydrogen electrode whose value is considered as zero, as shown in the table. Therefore, option B is a correct statement.

The metals having electrode potential lower than that of hydrogen are known as anodic metals, and not as cathodic metals. Option C is a correct statement.

The surface of the object changes from an element to a compound and not to another element. For example, aluminum develops a thin oxidation layer immediately upon exposure to the atmosphere. The oxide film protects the surface from further oxidation. This is a change from an element to a compound. Therefore, option D is an incorrect statement.

A relatively large range of rotary motion is required at the hip by a ball-and-socket type of joint. The joint is susceptible to fatigue and fracture. Diseased and fractured joint have been successfully replaced by a metallic joint. The problem statement isolates the fatigue and fracture as the sole criterion for selection.

The term “fatigue fracture” is defined as the fracture that is caused by repeatedly applied fatigue stresses. The fatigue strength is directly related to the ultimate strength of the metal. The fatigue fracture stresses are well below the tensile strength of the metal or alloy used. The higher the tensile strength, the higher the fatigue fracture stress, given the fatigue stress level.

[[./images/000272.png]]  

**step 1: **

Consider the length of each tube, *L* = 1 m. Use m as the length unit. All parameters can be calculated form the data provided.
[[./images/000241.png]]

**step 2: **

The shape factor *F*12 is the fraction of the radiation leaving surface 1 that is intercepted by surface 2. From the conservation equation, its value is 1.

**step 3: **

Assume that the radiation energy is flowing from surface 1 to surface 2—from the outer surface of the inner tube to the inner surface of the outer tube. Determine the heat gain using the energy exchange formula.
[[./images/000798.png]]  
The negative sign indicates that the radiation energy is traveling from surface 2 to surface 1 and not from surface 1 to surface 2.

**step 1: **

Failure of rivets by shear. The rivets are in double shear.
[[./images/000337.png]]

**step 2: **

By observation, the cross-sectional area of the center plate is less than the sum of the areas of the outer plates. Therefore, check the capacity of the center plate. It requires calculating net plate width.

**step 3: **

Failure by rivet crushing. By observation, check the middle plate since it is stressed twice that of the outer plates.

Reliability is defined as the probability that a product will perform successfully under specified operating conditions for a prescribed period. Reliability, like probability, varies between 0 and 1. The problem concerns 20 independent units connected in series. See the *NCEES Handbook*, Industrial and Systems Engineering: Reliability section. The reliability is defined as
[[./images/000623.png]]  

**step 1: **

The data show that out of 20 units tested, 15 units performed at or above the warranty period of 10,000 hr. However, 5 units failed prematurely. A unit is considered reliable if it reaches its full warranty life. A unit is considered unreliable if fails before the warranty life is over. In the reliability analysis, the operating time up to the warranty time is considered as shown. Determine the weighted average of the MTTF.

In preparing mechanical engineering drawings, which is of the following drawing practices is correct?

\(A\)

Specify sheet metal by its gage number.

\(B\)

Specify the method of manufacturing for the component to be manufactured.

\(C\)

Specify all angles between lines.

\(D\)

Specify each necessary dimension of an end product. No more dimensions than those necessary for complete definition shall be given.

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanical Engineering section. The ASME Y-14.5 \(2009\) on dimensioning and tolerancing, §1.4 applies.

§1.4\(h\) states that “wires, cables, sheets, rods, and other materials manufactured to gage or code numbers shall be specified by linear dimensions indicating the diameter or thickness. Gage and code numbers may be shown in parenthesis.” The rationale is that the gage number is an ambiguous property of a sheet metal as may vary with the metal and the other factors. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.

§1.4\(e\) states that the drawings should specify a part without specifying manufacturing methods. In other words, the means and methods of manufacturing should be left to the manufacturer. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

§1.4 states that states that dimensioning and tolerancing shall clearly define engineering intent. However, §1.4\(i\) states that a “90° angle applies where center and lines depicting features are shown in 2D orthographic drawing at right angle and no angle is specified.” §1.4\(j\) further illustrates it. In other words, for squares and rectangular shapes, it is implied that their sides have right angles and the drawing need not state the 90° angle. Statement C is incorrect.

According to §1.4\(c\), each necessary dimension of an end product shall be shown. No more dimensions than those necessary for complete definition shall be given. In other words, mention all necessary dimensions once. Multiple mentioning of a dimension sought should be avoided. Therefore, statement D is correct.

***The answer is \(D\).***

A cylindrical hole has a specified diameter of 1.00 ± 0.01. The nominal dimension of the cylinder so that it fits into the hole with clearance of ± 0.01 is most nearly *   *. Enter your response in the blank.

**** 

See the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanical Engineering section. Three definitions given in the *NCEES Handbook* are relevant: least material condition \(LMC\), maximum material condition \(MMC\), and virtual condition. Based on the dimensioning and tolerancing specified in the problem, the hole diameter can vary from 0.990 to 1.010.

Since the cylinder has a tolerance of ±0.010, the cylinder’s limiting dimensions are
[[./images/000487.png]]  
According to ASME Y14.5 standard § 1.4 \(a\), “each dimension shall have a tolerance except for those dimensions specifically identified as reference, maximum, minimum, or stock.” Therefore, add tolerance to the nominal dimension. The nominal size of the cylinder is 0.97 ± 0.010.

***The answer is 0.97 ± 0.010.***
