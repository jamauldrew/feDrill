The Code of Ethics for Engineers articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct.<br><br>In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for.<br><br>However, ethics are not subject to the law.

Not only does law in a civilized society presuppose ethical commitment, it presupposes the existence of a broad area of human conduct controlled only by ethical norms and not subject to law at all.” For this reason, a violation of ethics does not trigger a criminal penalty unless such act is deemed a crime under a criminal statute.

The parameters such as air and water pollution and atmospheric emissions are required in a life-cycle analysis. The *NCEES Handbook* does not explicitly provide information on greenhouse gases. The subject is covered in many textbooks. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds. There is no standard global method available for calculating the carbon footprint. Comparing the carbon footprint of different companies or products from different producers is extremely difficult. However, emissions can be grouped into categories.

Generally, the code provisions provide the minimum design requirements a design professional must adhere to. Sometimes the minimum requirements are adequate, and sometimes they are not. In other occasions, the code provisions may not address a situation at all. In such situations, local engineering associations or specialty institutes provide the state-of-the-art information for the design issue. For example, an engineer uses the code yet designs a building system that performs poorly in an earthquake. Should the engineer use the same code provision again for the redesign? If not, what design criteria should be used in such a situation? A reasonable approach would be to look beyond the code provisions and incorporate state-of-the-art methods in design.<br><br>The engineer is not responsible for job site safety unless the engineer assumes such responsibility by contract or conduct.

If the thickness of the cylinder wall is about 1/10 or less of the inside radius, the cylinder is considered thin-walled. In this problem, it is given that the cylindrical vessel is thin-walled. A cylindrical pressure vessel under an internal pressure is subjected to two types of stresses: axial and radial \(or hoop\) stresses. For a thin-walled cylinder under internal pressure, its hoop stress is double the axial stress.
