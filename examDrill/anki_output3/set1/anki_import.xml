        See the *NCEES Handbook*, Ethics and Professional Practice: Societal Considerations section. The parameters such as air and water pollution and atmospheric emissions are required in a life-cycle analysis. The *NCEES Handbook* does not explicitly provide information on greenhouse gases. The subject is covered in many textbooks. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds. There is no standard global method available for calculating the carbon footprint. Comparing the carbon footprint of different companies or products from different producers is extremely difficult. However, emissions can be grouped into categories. For example, the Berkeley Institute of the Environment focuses on transportation, housing, food, and goods and services.<br><br>***The answer is <b>C</b>.***

        Option A is incorrect because a standard of perfection cannot be met.<br><br>Option B is incorrect because meeting the minimum code requirement may not result in meeting the standard of care. Generally, the code provisions provide the minimum design requirements a design professional must adhere to. Sometimes the minimum requirements are adequate, and sometimes they are not. In other occasions, the code provisions may not address a situation at all. In such situations, local engineering associations or specialty institutes provide the state-of-the-art information for the design issue. For example, an engineer uses the code yet designs a building system that performs poorly in an earthquake. Should the engineer use the same code provision again for the redesign? If not, what design criteria should be used in such a situation? A reasonable approach would be to look beyond the code provisions and incorporate state-of-the-art methods in design.<br><br>The engineer is not responsible for job site safety unless the engineer assumes such responsibility by contract or conduct.
