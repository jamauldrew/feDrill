Assuming a linear temperature gradient, the underground temperature at 3800 m below the ground surface is most nearly<br><br>\(A\)<br><br>113°C<br><br>\(B\)<br><br>133°C<br><br>\(C\)<br><br>153°C<br><br>\(D\)<br><br>173°C</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>Geothermal energy is generated when water comes into contact with heated underground rocks. The heat turns the water into a steam which can be used to generate power. In this problem, the thermal gradient, *m*, is constant because the thermal variation along the depth is linear. Calculate the slope, *m*.

The Code articulates the ways in which moral and ethical principles apply to unique situations encountered in professional practice. It indicates to others that the professionals are seriously concerned about responsible and professional conduct. In some cases, it is impossible to comply with every aspect of the Code. Therefore, ethics are also called a set of aspirations that a licensed engineer should aim for. However, ethics are not subject to the law. As the late Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Earl Warren put it, “Society would come to grief without ethics, which is unenforceable in the courts and cannot be made part of law. . .

It is called errors and omissions \(E&O\) insurance, professional liability \(PL\) insurance, negligence insurance, or malpractice insurance. With the payment of the required premium, the E&O insurance protects the firm and its design professional employees from the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client or others.

However, §1.4\(i\) states that a “90° angle applies where center and lines depicting features are shown in 2D orthographic drawing at right angle and no angle is specified.” §1.4\(j\) further illustrates it. In other words, for squares and rectangular shapes, it is implied that their sides have right angles and the drawing need not state the 90° angle. Statement C is incorrect.<br><br>According to §1.4\(c\), each necessary dimension of an end product shall be shown. No more dimensions than those necessary for complete definition shall be given. In other words, mention all necessary dimensions once. Multiple mentioning of a dimension sought should be avoided. Therefore, statement D is correct.<br><br>***The answer is \(D\).***</div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header"><h3>Problem 109</h3></div><div class="question"><strong>Question:</strong><br>A cylindrical hole has a specified diameter of 1.00 ± 0.01.

Enter your response in the blank.</div><hr><div class="answer"><strong>Solution:</strong><br>See the *NCEES Handbook*, Mechanical Engineering section. Three definitions given in the *NCEES Handbook* are relevant: least material condition \(LMC\), maximum material condition \(MMC\), and virtual condition. Based on the dimensioning and tolerancing specified in the problem, the hole diameter can vary from 0.990 to 1.010.<br><br>Since the cylinder has a tolerance of ±0.010, the cylinder’s limiting dimensions are

According to ASME Y14.5 standard § 1.4 \(a\), “each dimension shall have a tolerance except for those dimensions specifically identified as reference, maximum, minimum, or stock.” Therefore, add tolerance to the nominal dimension. The nominal size of the cylinder is 0.97 ± 0.010.<br><br>***The answer is 0.97 ± 0.010.***<br><br><br><br># Local Variables:
